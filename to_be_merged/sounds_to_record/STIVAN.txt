~Ahhhh! I see seagulls EVERYWHERE!~ [TB#ST001]
~This is a fine group of ne'er do wells!~ [TB#ST002]
~Uhm... I felt more at ease while slumming through the streets of Athkatla.~ [TB#ST003]
~I am the leader? Wow!~ [TB#ST004]
~(Yawn) I'm feeling a bit drowsy.~ [TB#ST005]
~You'll fall by the hand of Stivan the Hunter!~ [TB#ST006]
~May the seagulls feast with your bodies!~ [TB#ST007]
~Heh. I was wondering when we'd be starting to get things done.~ [TB#ST008]
~Yahoo! To the assault!~ [TB#ST009]
~Ouch!~ [TB#ST010]
~(Ah)~ [TB#ST011]
~(Gasp!) I... I'm dying...!~ [TB#ST012]
~(Achoo) Great. This is but the first of many. I HATE nature!~ [TB#ST013]
~Ahh... I've always felt at east in the middle of crowds.~ [TB#ST014]
~Uhm... It's pretty cold in here.~ [TB#ST015]
~No matter how bright, the Sun's light cannot match the Moon and the stars in beauty.~ [TB#ST016]
~Stars are holes in the sky from where... where... *Ahem* it's really dark!~ [TB#ST017]
~Yeah.~ [TB#ST018]
~What do you want?~ [TB#ST019]
~There's no two without a three, I guess.~ [TB#ST020]
~Uhm?~ [TB#ST021]
~Nobody does something for nothing.~ [TB#ST022]
~It's my moment!~ [TB#ST023]
~Sure.~ [TB#ST024]
~Go fetch it yourself!~ [TB#ST025]
~Heh. I was expecting this.~ [TB#ST026]
~I'm gone an back.~ [TB#ST027]
~Alright, alright... I'll handle this myself.~ [TB#ST028]
~As easy as depluming a seagull.~ [TB#ST029]
~If I must.~ [TB#ST030]
~Is that all?~ [TB#ST031]
~Haha!~ [TB#ST032]
~Whoops.~ [TB#ST033]
~I need something else here!~ [TB#ST034]
~What did you mistake me for, some storage room?~ [TB#ST035]
~I've stolen a little something-something.~ [TB#ST036]
~Heh. I'll challenge anyone to see me.~ [TB#ST037]
~Oh, no! I've lost my concentration!~ [TB#ST038]
~Heh. This trap could be even more dangerous, had I some seagull poo to add.~ [TB#ST039]
~Eeeekkkk!~ [TB#ST040]
~You'll fall by the hand of Stivan!~ [TB#ST041]
~You will pay for your evilness with your lives!~ [TB#ST042]
~Nature... A unknown entity I'm slowly getting to know.~ [TB#ST043]
~As easy as depl... *Ahem* Child's play.~ [TB#ST044]
~This trap... will really hurt somebody.~ [TB#ST045]

~My fair Lady, I'm a friend of Aerie's, and I'd like to know why are you sending assassins against her.~ [TB#ST046]
~Whoops, I think she's noticed me...~ [TB#ST047]
~Yoink!~ [TB#ST048]
~Heh. A clean and easy job.~ [TB#ST049]
~This is for daddy!~ [TB#ST050]
~This is for mommy!~ [TB#ST051]
~And this is for my brothers!~ [TB#ST052]
~[Hiding laughter] Poor boy, he's gone!~ [TB#ST053]
~[Hiding laughter] Poor girl, she's gone!~ [TB#ST054]
~nnnnNNNNOOOOOO!!!~ [TB#ST055]
~What are we waiting for? Let's get to my tomb!~ [TB#ST056]
~K-Keep close, <CHARNAME>. This place is frightening, and I d-don't know how long I'll manage not to run away.~ [TB#ST057]
~Stivan the Hunter is listening to you, <CHARNAME>!~ [TB#ST058]

~... Not anymore.~ [TB#ST059]
~*Ahem* I imagine it's my turn. Well, I...~ [TB#ST060]
~I'm sorry, Aerie, I had been an idiot.~ [TB#ST061]
~*Ahem* Is it a wooden amulet?~ [TB#ST062]
~Well, I... It's possible it ended up in the possession of the wrong person...~ [TB#ST063]
~La... Last night, during my watch, I stole that trinket from her backpack and threw it away in anger. I later saw somebody picking it up, but...~ [TB#ST064]
~*Ahem* I think I figured out which building that is, but I don't know if I should be glad for the discovery or tear my hair out for what lies in wait for us.~ [TB#ST065]
~Don't look at me like that, elf. I'm a good halfling, and I'll prove so! If I rescued your trinket, would you be able to end the curse?~ [TB#ST066]
~Okay, although I can't promise you'll have them back. Heh.~ [TB#ST067]
~Are you ready to protect Aerie while I do my job?~ [TB#ST068]
~Later!~ [TB#ST069]
~Here you go, with my excuses for the mess I started.~ [TB#ST070]

~I thought you'd try more to help me, <CHARNAME>! Instead, you throw the towel at the first sign of trouble! I will have nothing to do with you! I'm gone!~ [TB#ST071]
~What?! I can't wait that long! My urn has already risked breakage far too many times!~ [TB#ST072]
~Nobody asked for your judgment!~ [TB#ST073]
~Sure! Where do I need to sign?~ [TB#ST074]
~ (Snort!) Give it to me!~ [TB#ST075]
~Finally the ashes of my loved ones will rest in peace. We just need to go to the Government Quarter, collect urn and paperwork and go in my lawfully-bought crypt.~ [TB#ST076]
~Heh. It sounded as if you were being sarcastic, <CHARNAME>...~ [TB#ST077]
~Heh. It must be one of my usual buyers - he must have run out of plumes while we were gone.~ [TB#ST078]
~<CHARNAME>, have I become invisible? I am Stivan!~ [TB#ST079]
~Yeah! Let's go!~ [TB#ST080]
~(Snort!) Stivan the Hunter is enough to handle that meanie! Either way, if you really need to look for further help, try and hurry.~ [TB#ST081]

~Have you seen a seagull around here? I am Stivan the Seagull Hunter, powerful and famous. Er... would you like to buy a plume? I have plenty.~ [TB#ST082]
~Yes, I hunt seagulls. They're the sea's vermin, and I bravely fought against hundreds of them. Hundreds, I say!~ [TB#ST083]
~Have you ever looked a seagull in the eye, eh? There is evil there... Pure evil. And I intend to hunt all of them... All of them!~ [TB#ST084]
~Ooh! Traveling in an adventuring party! Being their guide! Defending them against the aerial strikes of seagulls! WOW!~ [TB#ST085]
~WOW! It sounds anything but easy, but I don't care! Let's go! There are flocks of seagulls to deplume and...~ [TB#ST086]
~Since I'll be traveling with you, I don't know where to hide it, nor can I bring it with me. There's a strong risk it might break while I'm blinding an enemy with seagull poo or suffocating another with a bunch of plumes. It's not an easy job, you know?~ [TB#ST087]
~Heh. I'm looking forward to selling my last plumes, so that I might hunt more seagulls!~ [TB#ST088]
~You there! Why don't you buy this beautiful plum? It's the best thing ever to write the epicest of poems, or to cast the deadliest of arrows!~ [TB#ST089]
~Incredible! I'll travel with a noble! And what a noble! WOW! It'll be my honor to be your humble servant!~ [TB#ST090]
~(Achoo) Oh, no. I'm allergic to tree-huggers!~ [TB#ST091]
~(Sniff sniff) I can smell the stink of correctness in here...~ [TB#ST092]
~Eeekkk! The horror!~ [TB#ST093]
~*Ahem* Pardon? Are you turning down the most skilled seagull hunter in Faerun?~ [TB#ST094]
~Come, ladies and gents, come! Two plumes for the price of three! No, wait, two plumes for the price of four!~ [TB#ST095]
~Uhm... I'm afraid I'm doing something wrong...~ [TB#ST096]
