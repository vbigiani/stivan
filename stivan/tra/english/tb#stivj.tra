@0    = ~(Gasp!)~
@1    = ~Safe... by a straw!~
@2    = ~<CHARNAME>, the urn containing my close ones was about to fall out of my backpack! You promised me you'd help me find somewhere safe to stash it, so... Let's find that somewhere, please!~
@3    = ~Uhm?~
@4    = ~There's something wrong. My pack feels strange.~
@5    = ~I made sure to put everything in perfect balance, but...~
@6    = ~Eeekkk! Eeeekkkk! EEEEEKKKKK!~
@7    = ~Is everything all right, Stivan?~
@8    = ~By the gods, halfling! Could you stop screaming like that?~
@9    = ~You'll put your things in place next stop. We don't have time to waste on that now~
@10   = ~My... My urn! It's in pieces! Shattered!~
@11   = ~*SOB*! My... My dear ones... scattered to the wind... like this...~
@12   = ~It... It's all your fault, <CHARNAME>! You promised me that we'd stash it somewhere safe, and you completely forgot about my only demand!~
@13   = ~I imagine it broke during the last battle. I'm sorry, Stivan.~
@14   = ~You're right. I completely forgot about it. Let's get to it now!~
@15   = ~Try to be understanding. There are so many things I have to take care of...~
@16   = ~(Snort!) Shut up! Your excuses are nothing! My relatives' memory is forever tainted, and it's all your fault!~
@17   = ~I... Have no intention to fight for you any longer. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>! Might the seagulls feast on your vile bodies!~
@18   = ~Looking for a tomb.

While we were exploring the Bridge District we found Stivan, an halfling native of Athkatla, whom I asked for help in my search of Imoen and Irenicus. In exchange for a tomb where he might put the ashes of his close ones, Stivan offered us his guidance in his town and his defense against... er... seagulls. The halfling said I should go in the Government District and ask some clerk in the Council of Six.~
@19   = ~Looking for a tomb.

The clerk in the Council of Six Building has started the procedures required to make Stivan properly acquire the tomb. He promised he will send for us as soon as he is done, and also offered to keep the urn safe in the meantime.~
@20   = ~Looking for a tomb.

A clerk in the Council of Six Building explained us that there are currently no free tombs. However, he also mentioned that there is one where no one dares to tread because of voices about its inhabitant. Not scared by such tales, I decided to explore it: after cleaning it of any trouble I might find, in fact, we'd be free to claim it for Stivan's relatives..~
@21   = ~Looking for a tomb.

A messenger informed us that the documents for the transferal of the crypt are ready. I can go pick them up any time I wish from the clerk Lawrence in the Council of Six building.~
@22   = ~Looking for a tomb.

The urn containing the ashes of the Stivan's family broke before I could find a proper tomb for it. The halfling, furious, left the party.~
@23   = ~(Sigh) It doesn't seem real. I'm about to leave this urn behind. I'm about to give the final goodbye to my family...~
@24   = ~Come on, Stivan. Be strong.~
@25   = ~You aren't changing your mind, are you? I'd feel *slightly* disappointed if you decided to keep it with you.~
@26   = ~It's not a final goodbye. As long as the deceased live in our memories, they don't really die.~
@27   = ~It is just that the dead rest in peace. You can't imagine how much I would have wanted to properly bury Gorion...~
@28   = ~I didn't change my mind, <CHARNAME>, It's just...~
@29   = ~This *is* a final goodbye, <CHARNAME>! I... I lived too long trapped in the sorrow over my family's death! I... must go on!~
@30   = ~I... understand that your foster father's death was harsh on you, and that you wish you could have buried him, but...~
@31   = ~Do you think it easy? Do you think it easy to forever leave those that loved you behind? As soon as I leave their remains here, I... I will be alone!~
@32   = ~This is not true. You have many friends around you, me included.~
@33   = ~Your family disappeared many years ago, Stivan, not now.  All you're doing now is leaving their remains where they should have been for all this time.~
@34   = ~We're all alone. Use this experience to learn how to live for yourself.~
@35   = ~Are you telling me that that urn kept you company for all these years? No offense, friend, but this is silly. You have nothing but a silent object in your hands.~
@36   = ~(You see Stivan's eyes fill with tears).~
@37   = ~Oh, no. I beg you, don't cry. I can't comfort people...~
@38   = ~Let go, my friend. Cry as much as you wish.~
@39   = ~Men never cry, Stivan. Dry your eyes, come on.~
@40   = ~So even men cry. Surprising.~
@41   = ~(Stivan explodes in tears, holding you close). *SOB*!~
@42   = ~(The halfling cries for many minutes, holding your venter in his arms. You hear him whisper something).~
@43   = ~Mommy...~
@44   = ~ (You stay silent).~
@45   = ~ (You hold him close).~
@46   = ~Shh... It's all right.~
@47   = ~Leave me, Stivan. You're making me uneasy.~
@48   = ~Daddy...~
@49   = ~(After some moments, the halfling slowly leaves your embrace, drying the tears that wet his face).~
@50   = ~Heh. It'd be better if I hurried up.~
@51   = ~Looking for a tomb.

We finally managed to leave the ashes of Stivan's familiars in the crypt. To thank me, he gifted me his "most precious treasure", a strange red plume taken from a seagull.~
@52   = ~(The halfling abruptly leaves you, drying the tears that wet his face).~
@53   = ~(Snort!) Your heart is colder than stone!~
@54   = ~(Stivan runs to the end of the crypt and puts the urn inside the chest. He also puts something else near the container).~
@55   = ~Mommy... Daddy... Brothers... Goodbye.~
@56   = ~(Sniff) One day Minsc will properly bury sweet Dynaheir as well. Her resting place will be so majestic that hamsters will rush from all over Faerun to honor her!~
@57   = ~I don't understand why townspeople feel the need to bury the dead in such restrictive places. Nature offers many a place that would be better for this task.~
@58   = ~Tombs aren't mere holding places for the bodies of the dead. They are also needed to comfort the soul of those who remain alive.~
@59   = ~Now that you put the physical weight of your tragedy behind, our walk nears its end. The last mile awaits us.~
@60   = ~I-I'm... I'm happy for you, Stivan...~
@61   = ~Might nobody disturb your eternal rest, halfling friends.~
@62   = ~I appreciate the essentiality of your last goodbyes with them, Stivan. You should be taken as example by all those nobles that waste treasures in needlessly wealthy funeral rites.~
@63   = ~Really moving. Had I a heart, I'd be crying.~
@64   = ~Ahh... Life is the most boring of adventures. It always ends the same way.~
@65   = ~Will you keep going like this for much more, sakphul?~
@66   = ~I haven't seen many things in my life, but death is the one I saw the most often.~
@67   = ~I can never recall: is it bad form to tell licentious stories during a funeral?~
@68   = ~I... I... I'm sorry, Stivan. I don't know what else to say...~
@69   = ~Hmph. I hate these melodramatic moments. Does anyone want to go bash someone in the head?~
@70   = ~We're all peers before death, so... if you were just, might Torm accept you in His house.~
@71   = ~Might the light of Helm guide their souls to peace.~
@72   = ~It might be trite to express condolences in these moments, but know that I understand your loss better than anyone else.~
@73   = ~*Ahem* You should know, <CHARNAME>, that the chest is trapped to avoid looters disturbing my loved ones. Whomever would be fool enough to mess with it, he'd be drowned in seagull poo and plumes. Diabolic, eh?~
@74   = ~To thank you for the help, I want to gift you something. Here: my most precious treasure.~
@75   = ~It's a red plume. I found it some time ago while depluming a seagull. Really strange, since they are exclusively white, possibly with some black or gray spots.~
@76   = ~Speaking about seagulls, I think I heard one. Could they be besting even here in the Graveyard District?! Let's rush out and check!~
@77   = ~Eeeekkkk! That wasn't a seagull!~
@78   = ~Damn you... You violated our Lord's tomb!~
@79   = ~Death awaits you!~
@80   = ~<CHARNAME>, don't you think Yoshimo has been nervous lately?~
@81   = ~Nervous? I think he's as cautious and through as usual.~
@82   = ~Yes, I saw that too. Maybe he's worried about meeting Irenicus face to face.~
@83   = ~No, I wouldn't say so. What makes you think that?~
@84   = ~I don't know. Yoshi has always been calm and sure of himself. Lately, though, he's been tense.~
@85   = ~Imoen and I weren't the only ones to be imprisoned by Irenicus. Yoshimo suffered from the same, but we still don't know why.~
@86   = ~You know Yoshimo... He always becomes unsure when danger looms close.~
@87   = ~I'm not really relaxed myself. I'm worried for Imoen's fate. I hope she's in no danger.~
@88   = ~Why should he worry him?~
@89   = ~The wizard that awaits us is a dangerous person. *Really* dangerous. His spells are really deadly - I felt them on my own skin.~
@90   = ~Danger is around the corner, Stivan. Do you think the Cowlies will welcome us with outstretched arms?~
@91   = ~Really? He never told me so.~
@92   = ~And if he were... If he were a Bhaalspawn as well? That'd explain everything, no?~
@93   = ~You might be right, after all. That'd explain his being imprisoned~
@94   = ~I doubt it is so. Even Minsc and Jaheira were captured, but they don't share my divine birth.~
@95   = ~I don't think my father went as far as Kara-Tur, although it is possible he stopped there to taste the local variety.~
@96   = ~Heh. As you can see, hunting seagulls improved my intuition. We'll soon see if I'm right!~
@97   = ~Bah... I can't wrap my head around this. I'll kill some seagull to get things straight.~
@98   = ~Eeeekkkk! You didn't tell me we were in danger! I worry for my skin, you know?~
@99   = ~Yoshimo! Yoshimo!! I don't want to become a bunch of ashes! You... you still have to teach me how to use a katana properly!~
@100  = ~Calm down, Stivan. I'm not worried. I'm sure that <CHARNAME> will be ready for whatever danger awaits for us. Isn't that so?~
@101  = ~You can be sure of it, my friend.~
@102  = ~Exactly. We'll see this obstacle through as well, together.~
@103  = ~Er... Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'll do as much as possible, but I still remain a <RACE>.~
@104  = ~We should continue, then. There's no point in wasting time.~
@105  = ~Fear is for those of no confidence, and you're not one of those. I don't think you hesitated when...~
@106  = ~EEEEEKKKKK!~
@107  = ~... It would be best if I calmed down our little halfling, before his screaming attracts too much attention. Lead the way, <CHARNAME>.~
@108  = ~*SOB*! <CHARNAME>... <CHARNAME>, why did Yoshimo do that? Why did he betray us?~
@109  = ~I have no idea. Yet it happened.~
@110  = ~Damn traitor! Might he burn in the flames of the abyss!~
@111  = ~It would be better if I didn't know. I lost my soul because of him and I risked losing all of you as well!~
@112  = ~There must be a reasonable explanation, although I can't imagine it yet. He stayed next to me for all this time...~
@113  = ~Io... Don't know what to think. Could it have all been calculated? Is it possible that every talk we shared, every battle we fought, every trap he disarmed... would lead to this? To betraying us?~
@114  = ~No. I think... I think it was all the work of that Irenicus. It was him to forced him to act!~
@115  = ~Everybody is free of choosing, Stivan. Yoshimo chose on his own on whose side he was, so he has no excuses.~
@116  = ~Had he told me he was under a Geas, *maybe* I could have solved that problem, don't you think?!~
@117  = ~Why are you defending him? Must I assume you are allied with that monster too?~
@118  = ~This matters no longer. Yoshimo is dead, and his reasons with him.~
@119  = ~...~
@120  = ~... Damn, I don't know how to think through this. I really cared for Yoshimo and I'm sorry he's dead, especially because he sounded truly regretful. But what you say is true. His choice could have been deadly to all of us. We all seriously risked our lives.~
@121  = ~*Maybe* you should ask yourself why he didn't do that.~
@122  = ~(Snort!) Don't be paranoid, <CHARNAME>! I have nothing to share with that wizard!~
@123  = ~I'd... I'd like to keep Yoshi's blade.~
@124  = ~Why? It would be useless. He was the only one that could ever wield it.~
@125  = ~Forget about it. I don't want to hold anything to remind me of that traitor.~
@126  = ~As you wish. It's all yours.~
@127  = ~Don't ask me why, <CHARNAME>. I don't know as well.~
@128  = ~His katana will be in my hands, not yours.~
@129  = ~I saw you take his... his heart *SOB*! What do you wish to do with it?~
@130  = ~I'll try to remove the Geas that Irenicus cast on him, so that he might rest in peace.~
@131  = ~I don't know. I'm still confused, but something told me to do so.~
@132  = ~He prayed to Ilmater before attacking. Maybe one of the priests of the Crying God could tell me something... something about those who fall in battle after recommending themselves to a deity.~
@133  = ~Time will tell me what I should do. I just want to leave this place, now. The air is full of death, here.~
@134  = ~Differently from you, I had no reason to hate Irenicus. I was going to help you fight him since you did so much for me: you welcomed me in your party and removed me from a life of poverty, a debt I could only repay by giving you all my strength.~
@135  = ~(Snort!) But now I have a personal reason to hunt that cursed one as well. I... will avenge Yoshimo's death!~
@136  = ~Can you hear me, Irenicus? You have made a new enemy today! Stivan the Hunter will find you, wherever you are! Might the seagull's hate fall on your head!~
@137  = ~I'd like you to make Yoshimo's katana usable by Stivan. Here's the one thousand gold pieces.~
@138  = ~*Ahem* I have another request, if possible.~
@139  = ~I'm listening, brother. What do you need?~
@140  = ~This katana was of the man whose heart I just gave you. I'd... like to use it, but I can't. It is bound to him.~
@141  = ~Why would you like to use it?~
@142  = ~Er...~
@143  = ~Look into your heart and ask yourself why. Listen to your soul, son, and think of your goals.~
@144  = ~... Yoshimo reminds me of one of my dead brothers, all right. I imagine that's how I felt close to him.~
@145  = ~I could save neither of the two, but in either case I can avenge them. That ugly mage will pay for having treated Yoshi like cattle to the slaughter!~
@146  = ~If it's like that, then goals are noble and just. In exchange for a donation of one thousand gold pieces, I'll remove the binding from the weapon.~
@147  = ~Wait a moment, I must ask <CHARNAME> for permission.~
@148  = ~*Ahem* <CHARNAME>, would you please give me one thousand gold pieces to be able to use Yoshimo's katana? Yo know how much I would love to use it, but, if you'd rather not do so, I won't insist too much.~
@149  = ~Pleasepleasepleaseplease!~
@150  = ~One thousand gold pieces for a blade that's only worth thirty? That's a no.~
@151  = ~I'd like to, but I don't have enough coin.~
@152  = ~I imagine that Yoshimo would be happy to know that his blade passed to you. Here's the money you need.~
@153  = ~I'll give you them, but on a condition: *don't* use it to hunt seagulls. Have I made myself clear?~
@154  = ~(Snort!) You're meaner than a flock of raging seagulls!~
@155  = ~Don't worry about it, I'll handle this! I'll empty all pockets in Athkatla, if needed!~
@156  = ~Hey, you! Don't move from here! We'll be back with the sum you asked, okay?~
@157  = ~Yeah! You're great, <CHARNAME>! I always said that you're a true friend! Thanks, thanks!~
@158  = ~Heh. As you wish. We're armed to the teeth, so I won't have trouble finding another weapon with which to gut those birds!~
@159  = ~Either way, thanks, <CHARNAME>. You're great! I always said you're unique!~
@160  = ~Should you change idea, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, you'll find me here. Meanwhile, I'll go back to easing other people's suffering in the name of the Crying God.~
@161  = ~I'll wait for you here. Meanwhile, I'll go back to easing other people's suffering in the name of the Crying God .~
@162  = ~The good soul and kind heart of Ilmater mean that He's not easy to anger, but he doesn't spare his wrath against those who caused great suffering. Might this blade avenge your friend's unjust sorrow.~
@163  = ~Here you go. You'll always be welcome in the house of the Crying God.~
@164  = ~YEAH! <CHARNAME>, I don't know how to thank you! Finally I can use it!!~
@165  = ~Ooohhhhooohhhaaah!~
@166  = ~Heh. This weapon holds incredible potential. I'm sure that the dwarf in the Docks we've already visited might improve on it. Either way, I'm euphoric!~
@167  = ~Heh. This weapon holds incredible potential. If I'm not mistaken, there's a dwarf in the Docks that might improve on it. Either way, I'm euphoric!~
@168  = ~Hey, dwarf, I have a question for you.~
@169  = ~What are you waiting for?~
@170  = ~Do you see this blade? It was of somebody close to me. I'd like to use it, but it was bound to him, and nobody else could ever wield it. Can you do something about it?~
@171  = ~You asked the wrong person. I'm a smith, not a mage; you'll have to ask somebody else if you wish to remove a spell.~
@172  = ~(Snort!) Thanks... of nothing.~
@173  = ~And what about you, do you have some absurd request like your friend's?~
@174  = ~We have work for you, dwarf.~
@175  = ~What is that about?~
@176  = ~Could you improve upon this katana?~
@177  = ~That's not my area of expertize, boy. I'd rather spend my skills as a smith forging artifacts or exotic objects, not mere weapons.~
@178  = ~Listen to me. I promised I'd use this blade to avenge the death of a friend, but I need it improved. The enemy that waits for us is powerful, and it's currently too weak to help me in that.~
@179  = ~Hmm...~
@180  = ~I never tried something like this in the past, but I don't think it will be a problem.~
@181  = ~If you'd like your dead friend's blade to be an instrument of vengeance, I need something of yours. Something that represents you. Something you'd never go without.~
@182  = ~Heh. I think I have what you need. Take this; it should be what you need.~
@183  = ~Uhm? What the hell is this strange whitish goo?~
@184  = ~*Ahem* Mommy always said that secrets cease to be so when revealed, so... don't ask me.~
@185  = ~Very well, very well, give me that. I could improve that katana, if you wish to do so.~
@186  = ~Two things, me friend. It will cost ye 15,000 gp for the work, no less, and without an apprentice, ye'll have to stay here a full day and help me run the forge.~
@187  = ~As ye wish.  Fer such a commission, we can start on it right away.  No sense in wasting time, then... it be best if we just get to it.~
@188  = ~So, do you want to improve upon you friend's weapon or not?~
@189  = ~Ooohhhhh! I never saw a dark elf. Were it not for the color of their skin and hair, they'd be the equal of their hated cousins.~
@190  = ~Miss Nalia is right. Let us burn some seagulls, instead!~
@191  = ~They say that drow are really evil and eat people alive, but this Viconia looks nice to me. Why don't we let her come with us? If worst comes to worst, I will find out what it means to burn alive in a pot.~
@192  = ~(I'd fill her with gold if she did that).~
@193  = ~(Snort!) Mommy always said that women aren't sexual objects!~
@194  = ~But of course. They often act as recipients that can dish out monsters (such as this example right next to me).~
@195  = ~Viconia, I beg you, tell something to him!~
@196  = ~The superiority of the female sex is indubitable and requires no discussion, sakphul. As for you, Red Wizard, I expect to see your words followed by action.~
@197  = ~The superiority of the female sex is indubitable and requires no discussion, sakphul. Although...~
@198  = ~Lil alerl velve zhah lil velkyn uss. The best knife is the unseen one. Maybe you could give reason to be to your useless life, sakphul, and gut that men without anyone seeing.~
@199  = ~Heh. Anything for dear Viconia!~
@200  = ~Nindyn vel'uss kyorl nind ratha thalra elghinn dal lil alust.~
@201  = ~*Ahem* Pardon?~
@202  = ~Those who watch their backs find their deaths from their faces. That rivvil doesn't know that his end is near.~
@203  = ~That's true of you as well, sakphul.~
@204  = ~I've been living in Athkatla since I was born and I never heard of this place.~
@205  = ~Your ingenuity is peerless, waela.~
@206  = ~(Snort!) I have no intention of going away from Viconia!~
@207  = ~Viconia, are you mad? How could you accept to undergo a Geas?~
@208  = ~I'm tired of having trouble with Surface beings, Stivan. He will do as he pleases... his fear amuses me.~
@209  = ~<CHARNAME>! Why would you allow such a thing?!~
@210  = ~I don't have to explain myself to you, Stivan.~
@211  = ~I never really fully trusted Viconia. Now, thanks to Elhan, I can be sure that she won't betray me.~
@212  = ~Io trust Viconia more than anyone else. This Geas isn't but paperwork.~
@213  = ~Do you think I accepted gladly?~
@214  = ~As you can see yourself, those elves were anything but cooperative. Had I refused, I'd have put the whole party in jeopardy.~
@215  = ~You... You don't have to explain yourself to me? Okay! Very well! When you put a rope to my neck I'll force myself not to ask you why!~
@216  = ~She wouldn't betray you! Not after all you did for her! I...~
@217  = ~Then why force her? I...~
@218  = ~Bah! Your mind is more evil than a seagull's!~
@219  = ~*SOB*! I don't want to lose any more friends to these horrible Geas! Yoshi died of exactly such a thing, and I don't want the same thing to happen to Viconia!~
@220  = ~That insufferable darthiir knows perfectly well that my kin's promises are as quick sand. From afar they seem solid and safe, but they prove fleeting and unsafe once you tread on them.~
@221  = ~Viconia DeVir isn't foolish enough to turn on you. Yet. I have nothing to gain out of that.~
@222  = ~What *the hell* are you doing? Keep your hands off me, iblith!~
@223  = ~Heh. I love you, Viccy.~
@224  = ~... Shar be my witness, <CHARNAME>: you'll pay for every insolence the little one inflicts on me. Might darkness engulf me if I don't keep my oath up!~
@225  = ~(Sniff sniff) Come on, <CHARNAME>! She stinks of paladinitis from every orifice! Why would you let her join us?~
@226  = ~She's obviously a servant of Good. That is why I let her join us.~
@227  = ~It is *I* who decides the party make up. Do you have any objections to that?~
@228  = ~She'll help us overcome the dangers of this place, then we'll bid her goodbye.~
@229  = ~Great. Whom will you recruit next? An army of paladins from the Radiant Heart? Let me know in advance, if possible, so that I might take my leave and let you drink to goodness and justice!~
@230  = ~Yours truly is more than enough as far as halflings go!~
@231  = ~Heh. Then it's not so bad!~
@232  = ~I'd say we shouldn't wait any further and open our way in this place of evilness.~
@233  = ~Hey, you! Do you have a problem with Mazzy?~
@234  = ~What's this? Small refuse waving a sword?~
@235  = ~Even if we are smaller than you, that doesn't mean you can treat us like insects!!~
@236  = ~What you want? I break your face, I break!~
@237  = ~Eeekkk!~
@238  = ~M-Mazzy... C-could you handle that?~
@239  = ~As for you, Stivan, I appreciated your gesture. I would have never imagined that you'd jump in my defense.~
@240  = ~Heh. You know that it was simply because I act before thinking.~
@241  = ~I actually think you're getting braver with time. You'll soon be able to face fearlessly a dragon!~
@242  = ~A dragon?! Where? *Where*?! WHERE'?!?!~
@243  = ~By Arvoreen, Stivan, there is no dragon here...~
@244  = ~EEEKKKKK! I don't want to die!!~
@245  = ~(Sigh)~
@246  = ~*Ahem* Is that all? You know, those one-eyed beasts really thrashed us. Just this once, I think that "thanks" isn't really enough. I never requested a reward, but this time...~
@247  = ~Hey! Where are you going? I'm not done yet!~
@248  = ~Wait, Sassar; take this money and rebuild your life. Never forget what you learned from this terrible experience.~
@249  = ~Even if I wanted, I fear I will never be able to do so. I... I thank you, my Lady, for your generosity.~
@250  = ~It is not a problem. May Arvoreen's blessing be with you.~
@251  = ~Blood and damnation, Mazzy! I didn't work for all that gold to give it to the first blind fool we meet!~
@252  = ~(Snort!) Do you know how he'll waste that money? He'll simply give that to whatever god he used to worship!~
@253  = ~He'll ask for forgiveness for his sins, and won't hesitate to commit to a monetary sacrifice as penance. I hope that his god will forgive him.~
@254  = ~Forgiveness? I do not forgive seagulls for what they did to my family.~
@255  = ~You should. Anger dries people up... and you are proof of that.~
@256  = ~Don't make me laugh, Anomen. You haven't seen a single giant in your life, not to mention twenty.~
@257  = ~I suggest you hold your tongue, small one, before I make you swallow one of those flying things you love so much.~
@258  = ~Maybe you would change your mind if you were buried alive. Do you want to test my theory?~
@259  = ~My mace will bury you soon enough, halfling.~
@260  = ~"Lowly folk"? How you dare, you ugly--~
@261  = ~Stivan, don't involve yourself in this.~
@262  = ~And would that be your answer? Mazzy, an insult begets a greater one!~
@263  = ~There's no need. Sometimes, insults define the people using them, than the people receiving them.~
@264  = ~... Did I get that right? Did you say... Saerk?~
@265  = ~That's the name of the fiend!~
@266  = ~Saerk... Farrahd?~
@267  = ~Exactly.~
@268  = ~It's not possible. It's a nightmare. The same nightmare as before repeats itself, the same one! Saerk is... he is the cause of my ruin! He's the nobleman that stole everything from me!~
@269  = ~(Snort!) I have some things to say as well!~
@270  = ~Let me tell you what we should do! It is time that that villain pays for all he has done! If we don't take action *now*, others will suffer what I and Anomen had to go through!~
@271  = ~I seem to recall that this Saerk is the man who stole everything you owned, is that right?~
@272  = ~I need the full details, Stivan. Who is this Saerk? What has he done to you?~
@273  = ~Yes, it is him.~
@274  = ~Saerk is the leader of the Farrahds, one of the richer families in Athkatla. He was... my father's partner.~
@275  = ~After my parents and brothers were killed by seagulls, I pleaded to him for help. I had no idea how to run my inheritance, but I thought that him, of all people, could have helped me.~
@276  = ~It was a complete mistake. That cursed man stole all my family's documents, and created forgeries that asserted that my lands were actually owned by the Farrahds since many generations.~
@277  = ~I lost everything. My vineyards, my farms. Even the house I lived in.~
@278  = ~*SOB*! I hoped I'd left that past behind me, but to know that Saerk still ruins other people's lives, exactly as he did with me... it makes me mad!~
@279  = ~Boo says that those who are unjust always get the best results.~
@280  = ~Boo! How can you say such a thing? All the years spent butt-kicking evil... destroyed by such a thought!~
@281  = ~Ohhh! I understand now! That man is holding his evil influence over you! We must stop him, before he corrupts this hamster's innocence!~
@282  = ~(I finally found an use for that useless "Dominate Animals" spells. And to think I was simply thinking of a way of ignoring that halfling's wailing).~
@283  = ~You want to take this men to justice? Without any evidence I don't think we'd go far. It'd be better to ask local authorities for help. Cooperation would be fruitful.~
@284  = ~As a spider skillfully builds his web to damage unknowing insects, so this man built his fortune over other people's disgraces. It is our duty to avoid his web to become even more fruitful.~
@285  = ~It looks like even merchants are now criminals, as if there weren't enough of the latter here in Athkatla. Maybe this would be the time to prove them that nobody in Athkatla is free to act as he pleases over others.~
@286  = ~This Saerk is far too similar to my old companions. By the Nine Hells, I say we kill him and loot all of his riches!~
@287  = ~It... It's very sad what happened to you, Stivan. I... didn't think that men could be this evil.~
@288  = ~Ah, a new surprise! The man behind the murder of this young woman is also behind the poverty of my young seagull. What will be the next development in this tragic story?~
@289  = ~I'm dumbfound. I've never seen such an abuse, not even amongst the higher ranking families in Athkatla. And for what? Is he trying to improve his own social escalation?~
@290  = ~I don't care what his reasoning is. We must do all we can to return everything to this merchant's victims!~
@291  = ~That rivvil deserves to be repaid by his own measure, although I appreciate his skill in taking advantage of the weaker.~
@292  = ~Saerk Farrahd is a powerful man, and his guards aren't know for their... kindness. If we are to make an enemy out of him, we should be careful.~
@293  = ~<CHARNAME> and I already met many self-deluded fools, but this hot-air balloon beats all of them. I suggest he spends a learning week in Candlekeep's underground. That'd calm him down, oh yes.~
@294  = ~We must act to defend justice, but with with the right means. An trial in front of a proper court is that what this person deserves!~
@295  = ~By Uncle Scratchy's beard! Merchants are con-men by definition, but the Calimshite knows no bounds! I haven't been this dishonest, not even during the Great Turnip Famine of 1348. All I ever did was sell carefully-disguised cucumbers as turnips. Since I was the only one to sell them, I was raking in money, but that attracted the attention of a tax inspector, Trax. You know, he was about to bust me some weeks ago, but I managed to get away thanks to the help of some adventurers. It is a shame I have never seen them since.~
@296  = ~The thief's tale removes any doubt as far as this man's evilness goes, but there are no proof of wrongdoing in either case. No, this must be handled by submitting it to the judgment of Torm.~
@297  = ~Are you still thinking about this? You don't need a mind as phenomenal as mine to understand that the merchant will continue doing so unless you kill him!~
@298  = ~The halfling's past does nothing except make everything muddier, so we should ignore them, for the time being.~
@299  = ~I'm in front of a fork, but I don't know what direction I should take. Avenging Moira's death goes against the Order's dictates; yet, not avenging her would taint the honor of her memory.~
@300  = ~What would you suggest, <CHARNAME>?~
@301  = ~Anomen is right. We don't need to dirty our hands with blood. The best way to make him pay is to force him into poverty, as he did with me and you.~
@302  = ~When the magistrate will acknowledge his guiltiness, he'll lose everything... and the old and the new abuse will be both avenged!~
@303  = ~Your sister's death won't go unpunished, Anomen. Saerk won't win, not this time!~
@304  = ~So be it. May Helm assist us in our task.~
@305  = ~*Ahem* Don't you think that prison would be better than this punitive mission?~
@306  = ~Do you intend to oppose us?~
@307  = ~Not at all. I was wondering if death is the best punishment for that wrongdoer. I'd rather see him spend the rest of his life behind bars, but if you and <CHARNAME> think that killing him is better, that is fine for me as well.~
@308  = ~Saerk won't remain in jail for more than a single day. He must have ties in the Council itself. No, I will repay Moira's death by the same coin.~
@309  = ~"Greater good"? "Seal our fates and seek it out"? I don't want to travel with this goody two-shoes paladin, <CHARNAME>!~
@310  = ~I doubt I did anything to deserve your dislike, but I'll listen to your objections without prejudice.~
@311  = ~The members of the Radiant Heart are hypocrites! They claim they fight evil and injustice, yet they do nothing to fight the criminality and poverty that thrives in Athkatla!~
@312  = ~I thought that same way when I saw thirty winters, but with age I understood that violence doesn't solve problems.~
@313  = ~(Gasp) ... I'm safe!~
@314  = ~You did it on purpose. Tell me you did it on purpose!~
@315  = ~I suggest you put a hold to your twisted tongue, halfling. You might pay dearly for your ill saying with people less patient than me.~
@316  = ~WOW! This is a nice house, old man! I thought that paladins had to distribute amongst poor people the riches they gain from their crusades?~
@317  = ~That we do, but a part is distributed amongst the servants of Torm. We have a family to take care of, after all.~
@318  = ~I wonder how big is this part you mention. Why do I think that it's larger than the share you give to the *real* needy ones?~
@319  = ~I will NOT tolerate further nay-saying. My wife and I had to work hard to afford this house.~
@320  = ~Yes... It must have been harsh work, especially for her.~
@321  = ~Your lack of respect is disgusting, halfling.~
@322  = ~(Sigh) Come on, <CHARNAME>; my family is awaiting for us.~
@323  = ~Careful what you say, paladin. I cut the throats of many guards that wanted to put me in jail just for sleeping on the streets. Keep threatening Viconia and you're on the list too.~
@324  = ~The friends of my enemies are my enemies, halfling. Heed my warning.~
@325  = ~You ugly meanie, you must pass on my body before you can hurt an hair out of her!~
@326  = ~Step aside, little one. I don't need to be defended by anyone, least of all one such as you. I'll get rid of this d'nilok by myself.~
@327  = ~Yet...~
@328  = ~Stivan, a especially nasty smells comes out of your backpack.~
@329  = ~My seagull poo is NOT to be touched!~
@330  = ~Tsk. Surface dwellers are the worst compromise between the size of their two brains.~
@331  = ~Cower in fear, halfling! You'll be the first to taste my new and unstoppable power!~
@332  = ~Eeeekkkk!~
@333  = ~Heh. Would *this* be your new and unstoppable power, Edwin? Or should I say... *Miss* Edwina?~
@334  = ~Shut up, nothing! I'll fix this mistake and then fix you up once and for all!~
@335  = ~Yoshimo, might I ask what did you do to make this man angry?~
@336  = ~Another time, perhaps.~
@337  = ~Are you saying... you brought us in the lion's lair *intentionally*? Yoshimo, this.. this is betrayal!~
@338  = ~It's not final, Yoshimo! We'll find a solution, a cure... Many things can be changed!~
@339  = ~I fear not, my small friend. Nothing can be changed.~
@340  = ~No! No! You must... you *have to* explain yourself to me! I... Don't understand... ~
@341  = ~I spent all my life understanding you don't need to understand everything. Time is a great teacher, but unluckily it kills all of its pupils.~
@342  = ~*Ahem* I can't wonder if the game is worth the price. We're about to make enemies out of the most powerful enchanters of Amn... for what?~
@343  = ~The halfling is right. I should remind you, <CHARNAME>, that it is the Cowlies who keep Irenicus and your friend in prison... do you want to go and keep them company?~
@344  = ~Tsk. Hypocrite and thankless. A singular combination of qualities, Valygar, that you deserve like no other.~
@345  = ~You can say whatever you wish, but I will never kill some innocent for...~
@346  = ~For what? For a deserving cause like <CHARNAME>'s? Ptew! I spit on you and your beggar morality!~
@347  = ~Ponder your next choice carefully, <CHARNAME>. This halfling's venomous tongue is already reason enough for me to leave.~
@348  = ~(Sniff sniff) Ranger, are you sure you aren't mixing up this place's odor with your armpits'?~
@349  = ~(Sigh) <CHARNAME>, what were you thinking when you asked him to follow you?~
@350  = ~When I was begging on the streets, nobody has ever been that generous to me.~
@351  = ~No noble ever gave you a single gold piece? The Argrims, for example?~
@352  = ~No.~
@353  = ~And the Jyssev?~
@354  = ~Neither.~
@355  = ~It is a ignominy! An affront! With half their riches they could feed all of Athkatla, yet they don't raise a finger!~
@356  = ~Miss Nalia, it is fitting it is so. Neither I nor my relatives ever cared about helping the beggars when we were comfortable. I imagine it's some sort of... punishment.~
@357  = ~*Ahem* Not that I am happy of that. I would have gladly done without.~
@358  = ~Jaheira is right. I didn't know about it either.~
@359  = ~And why should you know about it at all? The servants of Balance don't tell everybody where their strongholds are at.~
@360  = ~But the Shadow Thieves do. You should know that there is bad blood between the Shadows of Amn and the Harpers... Had this stronghold been here since I was young, the entire city would know about it.~
@361  = ~(Cough) What... What sort of filth is this? Not even the corners I slept in were this foul! Do... (Cough) do we have to continue? I... I hope not...~
@362  = ~*Ahem* This woman makes me uneasy, <CHARNAME>. I have the goosebumps...~
@363  = ~Just thinking about working for that woman ruffles my feet's hairs, but the most important thing is to succeed in your mission, right?~
@364  = ~*Ahem* Do we really have to? People, here in the Docks, claim that those who enter that house never come out alive...~
@365  = ~And what's the matter, my seagull? If death awaits us, we'll have the pleasure of traveling without needing baggage.~
@366  = ~Since when do they let such filthiness enter this rich district?~
@367  = ~Heh. The only filth I see, my lord, is what you have under your feet.~
@368  = ~MOMMY ALWAYS SAYS THAT ALL HALFLINGS STINK!~
@369  = ~It's not true! I wash myself every six months, at the least!~
@370  = ~Away with you, beggar! Having you near me takes the shine out of my pearls!~
@371  = ~Heh. They shine nicely, for fakes.~
@372  = ~It's most certainly the job of those tree-huggers! I always suspected they were responsible of what happened to my family, and these attacks are but further proof! We must investigate, <CHARNAME>!~
@373  = ~I know Trademeet - I've been there several times with my family. If we're lucky, we might find one of the merchants we usually sold our wine to. I'm sure they'll do everything in their power to help us find those smelly druids!~
@374  = ~WOW! This crypt is perfect! There's even some space for your party members, should they find themselves in need to take a nap here!~
@375  = ~None will desecrate the place of my rest. I'll cut your heads one by one and put them on a pike, so that they might scare away other snoopers!~
@376  = ~Eeeekkkk!~
@377  = ~Yeah! I was getting tired of those tentacled things!~
@378  = ~Stivan, the Athkatlan halfling fixated with seagulls. Always ready to argue, often joking and sometimes childish, he's followed you since your first meeting without fear, even if he has no quarrel with the one who has stolen your soul.~
@379  = ~Go back to Athkatla, Stivan. You have no reason to fight against Irenicus.~
@380  = ~I'm grateful for your help, Stivan, but you should get away from here now. You have no reason to risk your life.~
@381  = ~Stivan, the battle ahead of us is very dangerous. I need yo to do the best you could ever do.~
@382  = ~*Ahem* I won't follow you in your suicidal battle, <CHARNAME>. I won't risk dying without properly burying my close ones.~
@383  = ~It was a pleasure to travel with you. I'd gladly follow you, but my parents and brothers have the priority. They must rest in peace.~
@384  = ~I'm back in Athkatla. Good luck!~
@385  = ~Don't be silly, <CHARNAME>. After all you did for me, fighting at your side is the least I could do to repay you.~
@386  = ~You're wrong, <CHARNAME>. That ugly one is responsible for Yoshimo's death, and I swore I would avenge him.~
@387  = ~I will be at your side until my last breath. Together we will bury the blade of our dead friend in the heart of that monster~
@388  = ~You can count on me. Do you know how much seagull poo I stashed away for him? TONS.~
@389  = ~Remember: right in the face.~
@390  = ~Perfect. He has quite some tasting to do.~
@391  = ~Let steel talk for you.~
@392  = ~Yeah!~
@393  = ~Heh. I'll put a dagger in his back, if this what you wish, but I will make sure he is properly adorned with poo!~
@394  = ~(Gasp!) My... My body! It is still whole, yet... I felt some force pulling and pulling at me, and I feared it might have broken me!~
@395  = ~*Ahem* I don't understand. Are we alive... or dead?~
@396  = ~It is time to end this forever, ugly one. Might seagulls feast on your remains!~
@397  = ~It is time to end this forever, ugly one. Might your remains wither away in this place for all eternity!~
@398  = ~Isn't Haer’Dalis the name of that very thin actor with those long long hair?~
@399  = ~Yes, short one. Are you a friend of our hound?~
@400  = ~Oh, no. I simply saw him act a few times. Do you have any idea why would anybody want to kidnap him?~
@401  = ~But this, unless I am mistaken, is one of the actors currently employed at the Five Flagons. What is he doing here? More importantly, why does he have that dopey look?~
@402  = ~This is the actor that Miss Raelis asked us to find, I can tell him. But it's strange... he doesn't usually look this dopey. Maybe that ugly mage hurt him somehow?~
@403  = ~It would be great to have you travel with us, Haer’Dalis. Did you know I saw some of your last representations?~
@404  = ~Really? Tell me, which one enthralled you the most?~
@405  = ~“Go with the Cambion” moved me. Its drama is peerless. It was a shame that Biff came out of the stage's hidden entrance all of a sudden - the rest of the public laughed for the rest of the show!~
@406  = ~Tsk. Only the Primes could shed tears for some mediocre sentimentalist crud while laughing shamelessly because of a small mistake.~
@407  = ~*Ahem* Since we'll be traveling together, could you teach me how to be a better bard? I tried it, but unfortunately memory leaves me alone in the middle of a tale or poem...~
@408  = ~I'm afraid not, boy. The Art is an innate talent, a gift we have or now ever since our first cry. It is not something you can teach.~
@409  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, to you the awaited decision. Will we be exploring this unknown place side to side?~
@410  = ~(Sniff sniff) Unless my sense of smell is playing a trick on me, that ogre stinks of feathers. I know it sounds absurd, but my nose is always right!~
@411  = ~Try not to walk too close to me. While you have your wings no more, you're still a feathered being, and your odor...~
@412  = ~Hey! What are you doing!~
@413  = ~I-I'm trying to take care of this poor seagull. Look the state he is in! He needs healing!~
@414  = ~How you dare free that vile bird from the rightful caging he deserves? Hand it back *now*!~
@415  = ~I... will do everything in my power to make sure he recovers and returns to fly in the blue sky with his friends. But we need to save Quayle first!~
@416  = ~You can't do such a thing, <CHARNAME>! If the bird freer comes with us, seagulls will escape the tortures and depluming they deserve!~
@417  = ~I was wondering, dwarf... Why don't you forge some magical trinket for us in exchange of our help?~
@418  = ~I'm not an hammer and anvil dwarf, baby. The only things I wield are axe and shield, and I'll use them soon to open my way through the decaying bodies in that crypt!~
@419  = ~I used to peddle illegal goods as well, you know? Seagull plumes, to be precise. It couldn't make me wealthy, but I could put together enough gold pieces for a slice of bread to eat.~
@420  = ~Seagull plumes? Damn, my cousin Eduardo could need them to perfect the deathtrap he claims can fly. If only I knew where I could find him. I wish he didn't actually try to fly off in his creation.~
@421  = ~Am I mistaken or are those the lands of the De’Arnise? The Lord's daughter is known in all Athkatla for her generosity.~
@422  = ~Now that I think of it, you look a bit like her.~
@423  = ~How silly of me! You *are* the incredible Miss Nalia! How could I not recognize you right away?~
@424  = ~There's nothing incredible about me, really. I only try and use the things I have access to to help the needy.~
@425  = ~But that woman... That woman is Miss Nalia De'Arnise! She's known in all of Athkatla for her generosity! Why didn't you let her join us, <CHARNAME>? Do you have any idea the social standing we could have by traveling with her?~
@426  = ~Nobody travels with <CHARNAME> for such futile motives, Stivan. Some didn't even have a choice about it.~
@427  = ~Ah no?~
@428  = ~(Snort!) Why are you looking at me?~
@429  = ~Nalia, Try not to mingle with peasants, if you please. You might not notice so, but your noble births become unnoticeable just by standing next to that beggar.~
@430  = ~I a peasant?! I used to hail from a family of merchants respected all through Athkatla!~
@431  = ~Those times are gone, I see. Does this wretched thing come from the Slums or some other degraded district you visited?~
@432  = ~Hey, you! Why do you keep bothering Miss Nalia?~
@433  = ~Are you still traveling with that peasant?~
@434  = ~I already told you that Stivan isn't a peasant. And even if he were, there's nothing shameful in it.~
@435  = ~No matter how much you dress up a beggar in rich clothes, you'll always understand he isn't a noble by his behavior. But I lack the time for such distinctions. Get away from that group of orcs, now!~
@436  = ~Heh. Don't worry, Miss Nalia; that pompous fool is clearly bluffing.~
@437  = ~(Snort!) It is time to end this show! Try getting near to Miss Nalia and you'll have to handle me!~
@438  = ~A false step, *peasant*, and you'll find yourself hanged before you know it.~
@439  = ~We can't let Miss Nalia in the hands of that despicable man! We must free her! Or at least direct the seagull's anger towards him! <CHARNAME>, we must do something!~
@440  = ~Heh. If you would like me to handle this borrowing, <CHARNAME>, you need but ask.~
@441  = ~Thanks, but I'll handle this myself.~
@442  = ~Thank you, you spared me the bother of having to do that myself.~
@443  = ~You'll come and beg on your knees, I know it!~
@444  = ~Yeah! Let's go there!~
@445  = ~SEAGULL PLUMES! Go and strike!~
@446  = ~What the hell...?!~
@447  = ~Yeah! Here is it! Here's the necklace you wanted, <CHARNAME>!~
@448  = ~(Sigh) Do you have any idea how Edwin would react if I brought him a jewel instead of the papers he needed?~
@449  = ~Stivan, I think I didn't explain myself properly. I needed the *documents* that man holds, not some cheap trinket!~
@450  = ~Phenomenal. Really. A pity that the goal of the theft is a bunch of papers, instead of a neck pendant.~
@451  = ~Whoops.~
@452  = ~Don't despair yet, <CHARNAME>! I'll fix this this very instant!~
@453  = ~Hey, you!~
@454  = ~Damn you, halfling! You almost blinded me with those plumes! What the hell were you --~
@455  = ~SEAGULL POO! Go and strike!~
@456  = ~Ahhh! I can see nothing! Help! Help!!~
@457  = ~Here they are!~
@458  = ~Where are you, cur? Where are you?! If I catch you...!!!~
@459  = ~Run away, <CHARNAME>!~
@460  = ~Anomen isn't alone! I'm here myself, Saerk!~
@461  = ~The little child of the Fristbrowfine? What are you doing here?~
@462  = ~I'm here to avenge myself! It is time you pay for your crimes!~
@463  = ~Cor is so desperate he sends his son and this beggar against me? Don't make me laugh!~
@464  = ~You haven't changed a bit, monster! You've always been the same evil men who thrives in stealing from others, as you did with me!~
@465  = ~Again with that story? Your father's lands were too rich to be left with an incompetent fool such as you!~
@466  = ~Idiot! I told you that myself! That is why I asked you for assistance!~
@467  = ~It doesn't matter. You can do *nothing* against me. And neither you, Anomen.~
@468  = ~Soon the future will hold another decade of loneliness for you, young man, but do not despair: when the White Queen will fall, victim of a plot by the Black Queen, by the hand of a dark-cloaked assassin, you'll answer the call of Destiny, and will help the Realms on the path of safety.~
@469  = ~Oh, no! I don't want to remain alone and friendless yet again! Did you see properly between my hands' hair?~
@470  = ~We must see this problem through. I'd be ready to bet that the druids are behind my relatives' slaughter.~
@471  = ~I hear sadly of these news. Did that happen recently?~
@472  = ~No, it happened eight years ago, but I'm sure that those druids sent the seagulls that killed my parents and brothers!~
@473  = ~The animal attacks here in Trademeet only started a few weeks ago, so I doubt they're related to such an old event.~
@474  = ~Damn, I was so sure that... Well, it doesn't matter. *Now* they're surely behind all this chaos.~
@475  = ~Heh. It looks like bad things are happening in House Firecam.~
@476  = ~(Gasp!) That man is more dangerous than I thought! Is... is there a risk that he sells Miss Nalia as a concubine?~
@477  = ~Roenal will keep the girl right next to him. After all, he needs her to get the lands he desires. I can't say that he will not try to get rid of her after he is done.~
@478  = ~What?! I'd rather be eaten alive by a storm of seagulls rather than leaving Miss Nalia in such a fate! Could that meanie be as untouchable as he claims?~
@479  = ~No, he isn't. I'll give you some directions that you could use to rescue your friend. Of course, I didn't tell you anything, and we never met.~
@480  = ~Thanks to this man we have a path to follow now. If you need my help, <CHARNAME>, know that I'll do anything to save Miss Nalia!~
@481  = ~No! We can't let that ugly one kidnap Viconia! <CHARNAME>, let's follow her!~
@482  = ~No! We can't let that ugly one kidnap Jaheira! <CHARNAME>, let's follow her!~
@483  = ~No! We can't let that ugly one kidnap Anomen! <CHARNAME>, let's follow her!~
@484  = ~No! We can't let that ugly one kidnap Aerie - only I can mistreat her! <CHARNAME>, let's follow her!~
@485  = ~No! We can't let that ugly one kidnap Aerie - if I can't mistreat her, nobody can! <CHARNAME>, let's follow her!~
@486  = ~I... told you so! A dragon! Run away while you can!~
@487  = ~Don't get nervous. You have no reason to fear me.~
@488  = ~Don't get nervous. While your actions have been evil and shameful, you will not suffer my wrath. Circumstances require cooperation.~
@489  = ~I can't believe this, <CHARNAME>. We look like drows!~
@490  = ~Bah. I vastly prefer my real body. It's far stronger and muscle-bound than this one.~
@491  = ~Where did my feet hair go?~
@492  = ~My plump cheeks... Gone!~
@493  = ~I really don't feel at ease looking like this.~
@494  = ~Such a spell is nothing but incredible. Few wizards could dream to cast it.~
@495  = ~Have you seen how gorgeous I look, eh?~
@496  = ~What do you think, Stivan? Do you find me more beautiful like this or as a <PRO_RACE>?~
@497  = ~Well, we can now claim we went through a surely unique experience.~
@498  = ~You aren't the only one who feels disoriented. I'll need some time to get used to these looks.~
@499  = ~You're really unrecognizable, <CHARNAME>.~
@500  = ~Heh. Neither I can believe that I have smooth feet.~
@501  = ~It's true, your face is shallower than before. You're almost unrecognizable!~
@502  = ~Well, aside your skin tone, you're exactly as before.~
@503  = ~*Ahem* I understood from the first moment that she wasn't hostile.~
@504  = ~Heh. It looks like you're happy with your new look.~
@505  = ~(Blushes) Well, your qualities... they didn't change a bit...~
@506  = ~Heh. Samuel won't believe me when I tell him!~
@507  = ~I'm a bit vertiginous. I'm not used to such heights. Let us walk slowly, without haste. I wouldn't want to ruin my knees in a fall.~
@508  = ~Mi... Might I ask f-for a boon, most illustrious and e-endearing one...~
@509  = ~We don't have the time for such praise. Talk and be quick about it.~
@510  = ~Well, I... I... Was wondering i-if... If I could k-keep this... t-these looks...~
@511  = ~You'd like to remain as a dark-hearted elf? Did I get that right?~
@512  = ~Y-yes...~
@513  = ~That's outside reason. I will dispel my illusion and carry you to the exit. These were the terms, and I won't listen to other absurd requests.~
@514  = ~But...~
@515  = ~Silence! I will endure no replies!~
@516  = ~Am I mistaken, or is that halfling basically identical to me?~
@517  = ~The only good copies are those that show us the ridiculous bits of the originals.~
@518  = ~Heh. I feel like that was meant as an insult, Haer'Dalis.~
@519  = ~I would never dare, my seagull.~
@520  = ~(Gasp!) That man is unfaithful! He cheated his own wife!~
@521  = ~Who ever said that cheating on your wife is synonymous with unfaithfulness? It allows you to stay close to your lover for all life.~
@522  = ~Miss Nalia, I could have sworn I saw that noblewoman steal in the Promenade. How could that be possible?~
@523  = ~You'd always think that rich people don't need to steal, Stivan, but it's hard to change your own habits.~
@524  = ~You should complete your business with this Linvail as soon as possible, <CHARNAME>. The Lords of Shadows change continuously in Athkatla, and I wouldn't want someone to take his place before you reached your goal.~
@525  = ~I once wandered near those hills, <CHARNAME>, but they're nothing but an empty and poor area, if I'm not mistaken. I can't imagine what would some predators do in such a place.~
@526  = ~(Sniff) You're a really kind person, <CHARNAME>. You really helped those people, exactly like you did when you welcomed me in your party.~
@527  = ~Miss Nalia, have you seen what a heartfelt thing he did?~
@528  = ~Yes, Stivan. A great example to look up to, although I fear that the older families won't follow him.~
@529  = ~If I weren't already your humble servant, I would have served and praised him as he should, but your nobleness takes priority.~
@530  = ~Hmph. I think he could have spent some coin and given actual help to those poor souls.~
@531  = ~Don't diminish his gesture.~
@532  = ~To correct iniquities and eradicate poverty, you can't just lend a hand to the needy, Stivan. We must also help them walk until they won't be able to stand on their own legs.~
@533  = ~Well, I... Of course, Miss Nalia. You're always right.~
@534  = ~(Whispering) It's not true, <CHARNAME>, I'm with you. Sometimes our friend thinks incorrectly, but I can't contradict her. I would make her look bad.~
@535  = ~Er... I thought that Umar was only a tale told by halfling mothers to scare their children when they got in trouble or some such.~
@536  = ~Not that my mother ever needed such a thing.~
@537  = ~The Cowled Wizards are very good at capturing people. Unfortunately, they're usually the wrong ones.~
@538  = ~Heh. Mommy always said that her slaps were more than enough.~
@539  = ~Don't expect any help, since it won't come. You should learn how to defend yourself, exactly like I did.~
@540  = ~(Blushes) Don't... Don't say that, not even as a joke!~
@541  = ~Wow, friendly drows do exist!~
@542  = ~His friendliness won't help him when that female will tear the skin off his back for his insolence.~
@543  = ~Yeah! Go tell her that!~
@544  = ~Don't mix yourself in problems that aren't your your own.~
@545  = ~Could that be the best solution? I... After listening to the halfling's tale, I'm having trouble accepting the idea that that man is innocent.~
@546  = ~You said yourself that the halfling's past should be ignored in your judgment. We aren't asking ourselves if that man is guilty of improper acquisition; we're asking ourselves whether he is guilty of having sent the killers of your sister, and we have no proof about that.~
@547  = ~Uhm... You aren't wrong. Naming some random brigand guilty of the deed would make no sense. It's implausible. Rivalry with your father is reason enough for him to kill, especially if you consider what he did to Stivan. So be it. We'll avenge Moira's death.~
@548  = ~The decision is yours now, Anomen. I can't decide such a delicate question for you.~
@549  = ~I understand you, <CHARNAME>. I can't put the weight of such a decision on your shoulders. It is mine and mine alone.~
@550  = ~It is decided. I won't leave my sister's death go unpunished. Come, <CHARNAME>... Let us go to Saerk and make justice!~
@551  = ~It's not fair. If the small people were treated with more respect and less laughter, this gnome would have never done something like this.~
@552  = ~Tsk. Guards do nothing but harass the innocent. You have no idea how many times they chased me through the city without a reason.~
@553  = ~I vaguely remember you being chased by a group of guards for having thrown guano in their faces. Am I wrong?~
@554  = ~(Blushes) Well, Maybe... Maybe that one time I angered them...~
@555  = ~That one time, eh?~
@556  = ~If that ship has been the base of the slavers since they first came to town, then... then they've been there since before I was born!~
@557  = ~Daddy had your same problem. I can't recall whom he talked to, but he finally managed to see the matter through.~
@558  = ~Mommy always said you shouldn't trust the Red Wizards. They're known in all the Realms for their... *Ahem*... opportunism.~
@559  = ~Where did you find this human mistake, <CHARNAME>? In the middle of some pile of junk?~
@560  = ~That's not true! I wasn't looking through waste when <PRO_HIMHER> and I met each other!~
@561  = ~(That halfling is now on the list of pests to get rid of).~
@562  = ~Bah! It'd be better to live as an orphan than with a paladin father!~
@563  = ~Who am I telling this... I'd be happy to know that both my parents and all my brothers are in the Order just to have them back... *SOB*!~
@564  = ~Hey! I want to fight in your pit!~
@565  = ~I have no time to waste with your idiocy, shorty.~
@566  = ~List-~
@567  = ~You there, what do you want now?~
@568  = ~I want to fight in your pit!~
@569  = ~This is funny. Whom would you fight, shorty? Flies? Ants?~
@570  = ~No, seagulls.~
@571  = ~Seagulls? Don't waste my time.~
@572  = ~Waste your time? Don't you know I'm Stivan the Hunter?~
@573  = ~Stivan the Hunter? Two years ago I bought a seagull plume and you never gave it tome! When I catch you-~
@574  = ~How you dare show yourself here, shorty?~
@575  = ~I dare. I captured TEN seagulls before walking in here, and I'll fight with them to fulfill my debt.~
@576  = ~Hmph. I was thinking about gutting you, but this sounds funnier. You can go fight now.~
@577  = ~Have fun, Stivan.~
@578  = ~Some of my party members don't want to see animal fights. Wait 'til I distract them.~
@579  = ~I want nothing to do with such a thing.~
@580  = ~So you want to be a goody two-shoes? The halfling owes me one hundred gold pieces. Cough them up.~
@581  = ~So be it - take the money.~
@582  = ~Forget about it.~
@583  = ~Do you have shorty's money?~
@584  = ~I think Stivan would rather fight.~
@585  = ~Yes, here's the one hundred coins.~
@586  = ~Fine. Now get out of my sight!~
@587  = ~Get out of my sight. Don't come back without the money.~
@588  = ~Hmph. Congratulations, you paid the debt off.~
@589  = ~Do you want something else, or do you just want to waste my time?~
@590  = ~Wow! I wish my plumes were this sharp!~
@591  = ~You bought that from the Hook, right? That barman has the bad habit of diluting wine with water.~
@592  = ~I say we join them. The Fallen Paladins, I mean. We can get rich illegally and taint the Radiant Heart's honor... No negative side, I say!~
@593  = ~I hope your leader is smarter than you are, halfling.~
@594  = ~Yippee! We don't have to obey paladins!~
@595  = ~I know someone who knows someone... We can rack up some nice coin by selling that cup!~
@596  = ~If you dare talk of such things again I'll remove your tongue, Stivan!~
@597  = ~Who told you my name?~
@598  = ~The same person that would warn me if you tried to see your plan through.~
@599  = ~We obeyed paladins and killed some friendly smugglers all for a pair of gauntlets? Bah, what a waste of time and chance for making money.~
@600  = ~Your actions helped Good, so I will ignore your insults, for now. I suggest you don't show again in this place, Stivan.~
@601  = ~(Snort!) Such tragedies wouldn't happen if the guard did its job!~
@602  = ~I don't doubt that the local militia is incompetent, Stivan, but you should never accuse without offering new ideas.~
@603  = ~Why such worry for some spiders?~
@604  = ~To a Nature servant, preserving the life of the Mother's creatures is the most important commandment.~
@605  = ~Heh. I didn't understand anything, except that you somehow want to help those small beasts.~
@606  = ~Saving that boy's dolly isn't enough - the killed must be stopped, before he can hurt another child!~
@607  = ~We'll end this menace together, Stivan. We can't let our people be hurt by such tragedies!~
@608  = ~Before the beggar, now the killed. Do you have some impure fetish for halfling kids, <CHARNAME>?~
@609  = ~I wish I saw your face if they stole your teddy bear!~
@610  = ~... Get the baby away from me, by Abbathor's buttocks, before I send him in the Abyss next to his beloved family!~
@611  = ~You can be sure of it, monster! Die!~
@612  = ~No! We can't leave that baby halfling's death unavenged, <CHARNAME>! I won't allow it!~
@613  = ~I'm with you, Stivan! In the name of Arvoreen, justice will be made!~
@614  = ~Heh. I can imagine myself as a spy, looking for clues or removing excessive witnesses. Stivan the Hunter is about to make his name between the Shadows of Amn!~
@615  = ~In case you weren't already aware, Stivan, we aren't playing guards and thieves.~
@616  = ~Heh. I want you in my team, Yoshi.~
@617  = ~Most importantly, keep the short one on a leash. I wouldn't want or identity to be compromised before we ever meet Mae'Var.~
@618  = ~(Gasp!) We were -- Umpppphh!~
@619  = ~I'm sorry for the interruption, my Lord. What's the name of our next goal?~
@620  = ~Heh. It sounds like a perfect plan to get rid of the Cowlies and this Edwin.)~
@621  = ~(I suspected the halfling was plotting against myself, but this plan is devilish. I won't let them send me back home to Mother. Not after she slapped me for having told her to shut up!)~
@622  = ~*Mommy* always said that the noble class would collapse on itself if it weren't for the middle and poor ones. How about this, eh?~
@623  = ~(Sigh) I wish I could recite poetry and tales like this mariner, but my memory, unfortunately, isn't good enough.~
@624  = ~If poetry doesn't grow as naturally as leaves on a tree, then it shouldn't grow at all.~
@625  = ~Congratulations, Cernd. You just removed what small appreciation I had for you!~
@626  = ~You are the last person he should talk to! You're part of that squalid group of bigots that judged unjust our vengeance!~
@627  = ~You have no small part in his corruption, halfling. It was you who made him drink from a cup of lies to wash away his thirst for justice.~
@628  = ~The boy always despised your goals and your morals. How could you not see how he used your weakness for his own vengeance?~
@629  = ~(Snort!) Pain gets people close to each other, idiot!~
@630  = ~Viconia, my dear Viconia... Have you slept nicely?~
@631  = ~Shut your mouth, you stupid Surface dweller. Your voice is insufferable to my ears.~
@632  = ~Heh. I see you're really charming today, Viccy.~
@633  = ~*Don't* call me wish such a name, idiot!~
@634  = ~As you wish, Viccy.~
@635  = ~Every time I walk in such places I feel sick. The sight of these fools praying on their knees is unbearable!~
@636  = ~On the contrary, the devotion they hold towards their god is admirable. I doubt you would be able of such.~
@637  = ~Lucky me. What would I get out of it, Anomen? Illusions? False hope? Some minor spell?~
@638  = ~Faith. During hardships, faith lends courage and strength, hope and comfort; something you can hold on to move on.~
@639  = ~I can't see how that could help us normal folk. The only ones who get anything out of that are you healers.~
@640  = ~When you are near your death in battle it is a cleric who saves your life. Did you forget that, petty thief?~
@641  = ~You're right. Next time I'll let myself die.~
@642  = ~Hmph. In such moments you won't bet this brave. Trust me.~
@643  = ~Luckily this man offered to give his own good word for us. It would be terrible to be forced to fight with our companions from the Order.~
@644  = ~Terrible? This is a lifetime dream! I always wished to have legions of paladins chasing me!~
@645  = ~A bizarre dream, halfling. Thanks to Torm, it will remain such.~
@646  = ~Do you think your own god would stop me from cutting your friends up?~
@647  = ~I think <CHARNAME>'s good sense will be enough. Isn't that true, my young friend?~
@648  = ~Absolutely, Keldorn. I have no intention of making enemies out of the Radiant Heart.~
@649  = ~I'll accept Garren's help, if that's what you mean.~
@650  = ~Actually, Stivan's idea sounds fun. I think it would be interesting to gut some paladins.~
@651  = ~I'll go my way, Keldorn. If your brothers dare attack me, I will defend myself.~
@652  = ~Damn party-poppers! If my blade won't cut them up, I hope the seagulls' beaks will!~
@653  = ~Yeah! That's what I wanted to hear!~
@654  = ~I hope acts won't follow your words, <CHARNAME>. You know very well that I won't hesitate in turning against you if you dare to attack my brothers.~
@655  = ~Wow. I'm speechless. I didn't think that love could beat death.~
@656  = ~I know a poem very appropriate for that couple's tale. Would you like to hear it, my sea bird?~
@657  = ~I'm listening.~
@658  = ~"When I kiss your scented lips,
my dear, I can't forget
that a white skull hides behind it".~
@659  = ~"When I hold your soft body near,
I can't forget, my dear,
that a skeleton hides behind it".~
@660  = ~"And absorbed in the horrid vision,
wherever I touch, or kiss, or hold,
I can feel the cold bones of the dead".~
@661  = ~Well? What do you think about it?~
@662  = ~Well, your poem represents love with icy objectiveness, emptying it of all of its warmth. They're... cold.~
@663  = ~On the contrary, I feel that they are a mixture of eroticism and necrophilia, sensuality and decadence. Love and death are bound, a tie that no strength could break.~
@664  = ~Isn't that right, my dove?~
@665  = ~(Blushes)~
@666  = ~If you say so, Haer'Dalis...~
@667  = ~I'm tired... We've been marching and fighting all day! Can we... can we rest?~
@668  = ~Stop complaining, Aerie! I'm exhausted as well, but I don't spend my time uttering sentences like "my legs are just aching" or "I've never walked so much in my life"!~
@669  = ~But... But I...~
@670  = ~You dare reply?~
@671  = ~B-but come on! I think I have all right to complain if I'm tired! And I was talking to <CHARNAME>, not you!~
@672  = ~Aerie! Stivan! What is going on?~
@673  = ~Tsk. You can't even utter a complete phrase without stuttering. Where did you use to live? The world has put and will put obstacles in front of all of us, but that's not reason enough to whine all day long!~
@674  = ~W-what do you know of the hardships I went through? I lost my wings! You don't know what it means to have everything dear torn from you!~
@675  = ~Oh, I am moved. Our little elf lost her wings... Poor girl!~
@676  = ~D-don't... Don't mock me!~
@677  = ~I lost everything dear I had as well, but I'm not whining and crying in public. Pain is an experience to live privately; spelling it out only proves that you are so egocentric that you want all attention on you.~
@678  = ~No matter how hard your life was, that doesn't mean you can spit venom on others!~
@679  = ~Mind your own business!~
@680  = ~... Heh. I was joking, Mazzy. Don't look at me like that...~
@681  = ~I hope I made myself clear, Stivan.~
@682  = ~Er... Sure. Crystal clear.~
@683  = ~Tell me this, Jaheira: did your druid friends decide to have fun at the expense of those who live here?~
@684  = ~It would be best to avoid hasty judgment, Stivan. I'd rather we wouldn't talk about something we know little or nothing of.~
@685  = ~Things aren't what they are, but what they look like.~
@686  = ~Shut up, halfling. This is not the time for your "wisdom". Someone or something is breaking Balance in this place, and I intend to stop they!~
@687  = ~Jaheira, Do you feel well?~
@688  = ~I felt better, thank you. Being cursed isn't certainly fun, but I'd rather die than whine in front of that dirty slaver.~
@689  = ~You look really bad, you know?~
@690  = ~I'm not... (cough) ... I'm not in the mood for listening to your small jokes, Stivan.~
@691  = ~I wasn't serious, druid. You know full well how much I like you.~
@692  = ~Would you like to be buried together with Ployer, or would you like your own tomb?~
@693  = ~Hey, I was serious, just that once!~
@694  = ~I... I didn't want to be this angry. This curse is having a bad effect on my behavior.~
@695  = ~Really? I see no difference.~
@696  = ~... The day I lose my temper, Stivan, you'd be better me miles away.~
@697  = ~So, Jaheira, how do you feel now?~
@698  = ~By Silvanus' beard, Stivan! Will you let me be?~
@699  = ~Hey! I only asked if you felt well!~
@700  = ~Do you think me a fool? I know very well that you're just looking forward to mocking me once again!~
@701  = ~No, not now. I... was taken back by your strength. A lot of misfortunes fell on you lately, like the loss of your husband or Ployer's curse, yet you always fight back with courage and determination.~
@702  = ~I simply move on, Stivan. There's vengeance to be done.~
@703  = ~Yes, but... I can't be as strong as you. Many years passed since... since my family's death, yet I still can't get over it.~
@704  = ~... Many things happen, that look like questions. Days pass, or years pass, and life tells you the answer.~
@705  = ~With time you learn that love isn't depending on someone, company isn't safeness. You learn than kisses aren't contacts, gifts aren't promises.~
@706  = ~The cycle of seasons teaches you to build your own roads today, since tomorrow is too uncertain for plans; it teaches you that the only certainty of life is death, and it is the only thing you never know anything of.~
@707  = ~And you begin to accept defeats proudly, with open eyes and an adult's grace, not with a child's pain.~
@708  = ~And you learn that you can't but be strong.~
@709  = ~Khalid...~
@710  = ~*SOB*!~
@711  = ~I... I didn't want to make you sad, Stivan. You'd be better to look somewhere else for comfort. I... fear I'm not the best person for this.~
@712  = ~Jaheira, might I ask why you chose to join <CHARNAME>'s party?~
@713  = ~When Khalid and I met him the first time, <CHARNAME> was a young, inexperienced <PRO_MANWOMAN>, needing for guidance. Gorion, <PRO_HISHER> foster father, asked us many times to look after him if anything happened to him, and so it was.~
@714  = ~Who is Khalid?~
@715  = ~Khalid is... was my husband.~
@716  = ~*Ahem* What happened to him? Did we lose him along the road?~
@717  = ~Your jokes are in bad taste, but I'll ignore them. My husband fell by hand of the wizard we're looking for, and I will have no peace until he his avenged.~
@718  = ~Damn, I'm sorry. I didn't know about that.~
@719  = ~There was no way you could know this. Now, if you're done...~
@720  = ~Well, now I can't help but ask another thing.~
@721  = ~Speak, if you must, but I can't ensure an answer. You're touching wounds that are still open.~
@722  = ~You paid dearly for keeping your word. I don't want to shift blame on <CHARNAME>, but, hadn't you traveled with <PRO_HIMHER>...~
@723  = ~What are you getting at, Stivan? Are you trying to ask me if I would have helped <PRO_HIMHER> even if I knew that it would lead to my husband's death?~
@724  = ~Exactly.~
@725  = ~This question deserves no answer. Khalid's murder... was part of a bigger plan, that goes beyond our understanding. Especially yours!~
@726  = ~Hey, there's no need to get defensive. Don't forget I lost my family, too.~
@727  = ~My anger is fully justified! They killed Khalid! They violated his corpse, forever taking my husband from me! How could I not be angry?~
@728  = ~I just... wish I could have offered myself in his stead.~
@729  = ~... Jaheira, I--~
@730  = ~No. I don't want your condolence.~
@731  = ~Damnation! I want to get out of here alive! I was about to lose my arms under those beasts' bites!~
@732  = ~Calm down, Stivan, or you'll attract attention. There is danger everywhere in this place, and screaming like that could be dangerous.~
@733  = ~Is it too much to ask to get back to Athkatla with all our limbs still attached?!~
@734  = ~Is it too much to ask not to reveal our position to every creature that dwells here?~
@735  = ~You and your damned ancestor! We'll all end up killed!~
@736  = ~No, Stivan. It will be Lavok who will end up killed, once and for all.~
@737  = ~Enough! I can't take any more monsters! My hands are so tired they are bleeding! My head is about to blow up! If that wasn't enough, I've ran out of plumes! And it's all thanks to your woman, ranger!~
@738  = ~What?! Are you accusing Suna Seni of our current situation? It was that Irenicus monster who forced her to work for him!~
@739  = ~*Ahem* She wasn't forced. She accepted in exchange of a rather large sum, right?~
@740  = ~Nobody is innocent, Stivan. We're all guilty in this place. All. Each of us in his own way.~
@741  = ~But I did nothing!~
@742  = ~Then he, who is guiltless, toss the first stone.~
@743  = ~... Eh?~
@744  = ~(Sigh) Ignore that. Let us return to the search for a way out of this place.~
@745  = ~M-Mazzy, did you hear them? Those monsters were about to eat us! They wanted to feast with *my* and *your* limbs!~
@746  = ~This encounter leaves me confused, Stivan, even scared. I never saw halfling... cannibals.~
@747  = ~How could they wish to eat their own kind?~
@748  = ~Hunger is a bad thing. I think that, hadn't we met them, they would end up eating each other.~
@749  = ~Heh. I think I would've eaten an arm or leg of yours, rather than dying of starvation.~
@750  = ~I couldn't say the same, Stivan. Harsh and cynic as you are, I doubt you'd be safe to eat.~
@751  = ~I'm happy that Kram found an honest job. With some determination and good will, he can build his own future.~
@752  = ~More skilled fingers removed from the fine art of theft... Where will we end up?~
@753  = ~By saying such things, Stivan, people will continue calling halflings thieves. Thanks to Arvoreen, tales like Kram's will erode prejudices such as that.~
@754  = ~Well, it shouldn't be too hard to corrupt him...~
@755  = ~I'm sure he wouldn't give in to the temptation.~
@756  = ~Perhaps I could steal something from Galoomp right as he sees? That might bring him back to a thieving career!~
@757  = ~When you behave like this, Stivan, I feel the urge of beating you.~
@758  = ~Are you talking seriously, potato ped-- *OW*!~
@759  = ~Hmph. You deserve this.~
@760  = ~(Sniff sniff) What's this smell?~
@761  = ~Every corner of this place is filled with the odor of evil. We should advance carefully.~
@762  = ~Heh. I thought you let go a stinky, paladin!~
@763  = ~Eeekkk! W... What's that thing?!~
@764  = ~Here. It's the dragon who defeated me and my friends. Although Amauna suggested us to leave it alone, I'm itching with anger at the thought of sparing such an evil creature!~
@765  = ~Fight you if you're fool enough! I don't want to lose my life in such a futile battle!~
@766  = ~No halfling should ever back away from a test of courage. David never feared in front of Goliath!~
@767  = ~Wake up, Mazzy! Reality is different from that stupid child's tale!~
@768  = ~(Stay silent).~
@769  = ~David? Goliath? Whom are you talking about?~
@770  = ~Uhm... I already heard these names. Am I mistaken, or are they the protagonists of an halfling tale?~
@771  = ~My ears are always ready for a promising legend. I beg you, tell me of it.~
@772  = ~You two, calm down. It's not the time to get nervous for nothing.~
@773  = ~That tale, true or false be it, has a teaching you should heed very well. Let me remind you.~
@774  = ~There's no need. I know it better than you!~
@775  = ~They're the protagonists of a legend that halfling mothers usually tell us when young.~
@776  = ~Exactly, <CHARNAME>. That tale, true or false be it, has a teaching you should heed very well. Let me remind you.~
@777  = ~Near an halfling settlement south of the Gulf of Vilhon was a group of giants that terrorized the local communities. To tell the truth, I can't remember the name of the village.~
@778  = ~(Snort!) It was the Forest of Chondal, ignoramus!~
@779  = ~Since you know it better than me, why don't you continue?~
@780  = ~You can be sure of it!~
@781  = ~*Ahem* According to this legend, many years of battles ensued, where halflings tried to cut up their enemies' legs, while giants had fun playing "throw the halfling".~
@782  = ~The situation didn't change until the giant's champion, Goliath, challenged the halflings that lived there. He and his tribe would leave the Forest of Chondal, if anyone managed to defeat him in single combat.~
@783  = ~Nobody dared accept the challenge, except some farmer named David.~
@784  = ~They met in a valley, known as the Valley of Elah. Certain of his victory, Goliath left the honor of first strike to his enemy.~
@785  = ~His confidence was his undoing, since David put his hand in his pocket, took out a stone, put it in his sling and hit the giant in the head, dropping him to the ground. He then ran to the giant, took his sword and killed him by cutting his head off.~
@786  = ~(Sigh) And that was why the halflings of the Forest of Chondal were freed from the giants' menace, as they fled in terror after the death of their champion.~
@787  = ~Do you see, Stivan? Courage's ideas are like pawns in chess. They can be easily eaten, but they might be the key to winning the game.~
@788  = ~Not everybody is a David in his own Valley of Elah, ready to challenge a much bigger and stronger enemy. Neither can anyone kill a giant. Rarely the "good ones" win and live to tell the tale.~
@789  = ~We'll fight the dragon, Stivan, whether you like it or not.~
@790  = ~It's too dangerous an enemy, Mazzy. We won't challenge him.~
@791  = ~I'll choose what to do only after we are done studying our enemy. It's not a decision to be taken lightly.~
! Eeekkk!~
@793  = ~I wasn't suggesting anything of the sort, <CHARNAME>. I already fought that beast, and I know very well how strong it is. The problem is... I can feel my fallen friends' cries. They ask justice.~
@794  = ~And they will have it. The Shadow Lord will pay for the horrors he is responsible of.~
@795  = ~Knowing your own limits is a sign of wisdom. There's no point in throwing away our lives attacking it; we'll make this beast's owner pay double.~
@796  = ~So be it. Prepare yourself, Stivan: we will fight the dragon.~
@797  = ~I know what you're getting at, but we should move on. We waited far too long in this place.~
@798  = ~You need to think about it, as if the best choice wouldn't be obvious. Well, while you draw your own conclusions, I'll think about the best hiding place, okay?~
@799  = ~Tin-head, it's been *two* hours since you last cleaned me! What are you waiting for?!~
@800  = ~Wait a second, Larry: Minsc is feeding Boo. He will take care of you soon.~
@801  = ~Now! You must clean me NOW, before rust takes over me!~
@802  = ~Very well. Boo, finish up your nuts by yourself; Minsc must clean his own blade.~
@803  = ~You must be really stupid, ranger, to satisfy that weapon's every whim. If he talked to me like that, I'd have covered it in seagull poo until it learns respect!~
@804  = ~Minsc isn't stupid! He cares for his hamster and his blade to be ready for battle!~
@805  = ~Enough! If I won't get the cleaning I'm due, I'll taste some blood!~
@806  = ~OW! Minsc, are you mad?!?~
@807  = ~Minsc didn't do anything! It was Larry! Right, Boo?~
@808  = ~Nothing? You were about to cut me in two and you dare tell me you were doing nothing?! It was YOU who was wielding that sword! Did you forget about it?~
@809  = ~Larry acts on his own every now and then! Minsc isn't to blame if his blade attacks on his own!~
@810  = ~Dare hit me once again, sword, and I'll send you back in the sewers where you belong!~
@811  = ~Mwahahahahahaha!~
@812  = ~WOW! This body is... is incredible! I'm discovering and doing many things that were impossible before! Don't you find it marvelous, Mazzy?~
@813  = ~I don't understand your enthusiasm. I'm feeling really uneasy looking like an evil creature.~
@814  = ~What uneasiness are you talking about? Being tall and drow has many upsides!~
@815  = ~Your feet aren't hairy.~
@816  = ~Your legs and arms aren't short and stubby.~
@817  = ~Your neck isn't tired by looking up every time you talk with someone.~
@818  = ~You can make long steps.~
@819  = ~You can wield weapons that used to be bigger than you.~
@820  = ~You can take things off tables without needing to stand on your toes.~
@821  = ~You... You can do a lot of things!~
@822  = ~(Sigh) Enjoy the feeling while you can, then, We'll soon get back to our usual looks, you know.~
@823  = ~Heh. That's what *you* think.~
@824  = ~What are you talking about?~
@825  = ~I'll ask that friendly drake to leave me as I am now.~
@826  = ~What?! You would like to remain with a drow's looks? Would that be your dream in the closet?~
@827  = ~I have no dreams in my closet, Mazzy. I prefer to put my clothes in there!~
@828  = ~This is not the time to joke, Stivan! Adalon's spell is just an illusion. It won't change your nature as an halfling!~
@829  = ~Did you think about the consequences your looks would have? Once on the surface, people will be terrorized by your looks and will avoid you. Some will even try to kill you!~
@830  = ~(Snort!) So? This is not much different from what I went through all these years!~
@831  = ~People have always avoided me for my unwashed look, as if I could clean myself after losing everything I had. As for people trying to kill me, guards have been trying to attack me and put me in jail just for sleeping on the street. "We must protect order and peace", they said, while the district's problem were others!~
@832  = ~It would be better if those we meet are scared by my drow looks. Their fear would be out of respect!~
@833  = ~Stivan, calm down and listen to me.~
@834  = ~I understand better than anyone else how hard is it for a drow to be accepted by society. To most, we aren't but funny and frivolous creatures, scared and fat. Yet, I fought so that things would change at least for me, so that people would see me as I was, not as what prejudice tells them I am.~
@835  = ~It was a long and perilous journey, I can't deny it. I felt down on many occasions, but I always brought myself back telling me: "did you fall seven times? Get up eight". At the end, I proved to myself and others that I'm a strong, brave, loyal and honest person.~
@836  = ~... Heh. You did your best, Mazzy, but I won't let myself be moved by your little tale. I'll keep these looks, whether you like it or not!~
@837  = ~Think, Sti--~
@838  = ~Enough! I want to hear nothing more!~
@839  = ~See, Mazzy? *See* how these pompous fools stare at me? Had I kept a drow's appearance, they wouldn't look at me with such smug eyes!~
@840  = ~You're right. They would have pinned you to the ground with spears and arrows.~
@841  = ~Watch and learn.~
@842  = ~Hey, you! Is there any reason why you're staring at my friend like that? Didn't they teach you that it is rude to stare at people without talking?~
@843  = ~I look where I like, half woman.~
@844  = ~Are you sure about that? Would you like me to go there and slap you into looking somewhere else?~
@845  = ~Er... No. There's no need...~
@846  = ~That was easy.~
@847  = ~Be braver, Stivan. Even halflings, while trying to climb a mountain, might get to the top.~
@848  = ~(Blushes) Thank you, Mazzy.~
@849  = ~Don't mention it.~
@850  = ~You shouldn't expose yourself that much in battle, halfling. You lack tactics and discipline, and both are vitally needed in melee.~
@851  = ~Next time let me handle the bigger enemies: I can defend myself against them. Now, I should heal you.~
@852  = ~Heh. Thanks.~
@853  = ~Either way, you were right.~
@854  = ~About what?~
@855  = ~It is only when you fear death that you appreciate clerics.~
@856  = ~Ready for the battle?~
@857  = ~Heh. You can count on it.~
@858  = ~Take heed of my lessons. We must do everything in our power to defend <CHARNAME> - I'd go mad if anything should happen to her.~
@859  = ~... Why do you care so much about her?~
@860  = ~The love I hold for <CHARNAME> is a rose that shows every morning a new petal and a new color, yet its beauty is always the same. No artist might ever paint the taste of her kisses, the perfume of her skin, the music in her voice. I myself aren't worthy to repeat the poetry of her name.~
@861  = ~I'm ready to give my life for her.~
@862  = ~Take heed of my lessons. We must do everything in our power to defend <CHARNAME>.~
@863  = ~... I'm sure <PRO_HESHE>'ll be able to handle this by himself.~
@864  = ~I don't doubt it, but it is our duty to defend <PRO_HIMHER> at any cost.~
@865  = ~(Gasp!) You can't promise such a thing!~
@866  = ~Don't worry yourself, my friend. It takes more than a simple mage to put me in danger. But enough waiting: battle awaits for us.~
@867  = ~<CHARNAME>...! <CHARNAME>, I beg you, don't let Anomen die! Please!~
@868  = ~Nothing will happen to him. We'll defeat that madman, once and for all.~
@869  = ~Rest assured, Stivan: I'll keep an eye out for him.~
@870  = ~I'll do everything I can to defend each and every member of this party. It's the least I could do after all the help you gave me.~
@871  = ~Rest assured, Stivan: I'll keep an eye out for him - he's too important to me.~
@872  = ~I don't know if we can defeat Irenicus, but promise me this: if anything should happen to me, don't allow Anomen to do anything rash.~
@873  = ~(Sniff) Why am I this scared? I was walking fearless towards the battle and now... Now I'm terrorized that that evil men might hurt us!~
@874  = ~If I shouldn't make it, I wish... I wish I was laid to rest in the same tomb as my loved ones. Should anything happen to Anomen, I'll cut you up myself if you won't be decent enough to accompany him!~
@875  = ~So, should you die, I'm authorized to stun him and bring him safe and sound to Athkatla? Is that what you mean?~
@876  = ~Exact--~
@877  = ~Act--~
@878  = ~Not real--~
@879  = ~Yeah! You're great, <CHARNAME>! What are you waiting for there? Let's get a move on!~
@880  = ~(Gasp!) Those creatures were *monstrous*! My head aches... as if they flayed it!~
@881  = ~Bah! The Underdark isn't the right place for pansies like you! Step aside and let real warriors do the dirty job!~
@882  = ~I can perfectly handle myself, Korgan. I just need time to get used to my new appearance.~
@883  = ~Looks don't mean anything, useless sack of goblin spit. Even when you look like a dirty longleg, I still know where to aim my axe.~
@884  = ~Right here... At neck height!~
@885  = ~Eeeekkkk!!!~
@886  = ~Har har! Look how he runs, the baby!~
@887  = ~By Arvoreen, Korgan! Don't you understand that scaring away a member of the party is counterproductive?~
@888  = ~Come on, Mazzy... Have some fun!~
@889  = ~There are fools who are very good at taking advantage of their own stupidity. You proved for the umpteen time to be one of them.~
@890  = ~I... Don't feel very well...~
@891  = ~<CHARNAME>, I hope you're going to do something to remove our friend from the cold embrace of death. I don't doubt that he's a creature too strange to live, but he's also too rare to die.~
@892  = ~Damn. My wound's blood has dirtied even my plumes.~
@893  = ~Minsc admires your courage, but he doesn't want his little friend to expose himself too much in battle! You should stand back and keep Boo company, every now and then.~
@894  = ~Why do you worry about me, Minsc? I... Don't think I deserve your attention.~
@895  = ~This ranger and this hamster believe you only act evil, and you can be sure that they saw evil so many times they can't be mistaken!~
@896  = ~Boo also says that you sometimes deserve some good lesson.~
@897  = ~Heh. Maybe I was mistaken in judging you, ranger. After all... you're a good person.~
@898  = ~Minsc and Boo are wondering why their little friend is so happy lately.~
@899  = ~This body is a real pleasure! Every simple gesture, from walking to breathing, looks new and completely different!~
@900  = ~Minsc doesn't feel at east wearing somebody else's body. Moreover, it is really hard to kick evil with these thin legs!~
@901  = ~What does Boo say?~
@902  = ~Boo fears that if his furry friends saw him this as black as this they would run away scared.~
@903  = ~*Squeak!*~ [GAM_48]
@904  = ~Can you hear how worried he is?~
@905  = ~Heh. It looks like I'm the only one who's happy with his new looks. All the better... nobody else will make the same request to that friendly overgrown lizard!~
@906  = ~(Gasp!) What's this sudden trepidation? Why do I feel this worried?~
@907  = ~I imagine that your soul is in excruciating wait of receiving justice, just as mine. Come, let us not waste any further time chatting.~
@908  = ~Maybe... I should wait here. I lost control of my heart beat, and I'm afraid it'd break himself if I heard the magistrate's sentence with my own ears.~
@909  = ~I'll wait for you here. I'll try to calm myself down, and when you come back... I'll listen to what you have to say.~
@910  = ~As you wish. <CHARNAME>, let's go.~
@911  = ~*Ahem* How did it go, Anomen? How did the magistrate punish Saerk?~
@912  = ~The court won't do anything to avenge Moira's death.~
@913  = ~What?! The magistrate won't do anything? He'll let Saerk go unpunished?~
@914  = ~No, I won't allow it. Moira's death will be avenged!~
@915  = ~(Snort!) If things are like this, we'll take Saerk down with steel and plumes!~
@916  = ~<CHARNAME>, to the Bridge District, quick.~
@917  = ~We don't really know whether that was him. It might be some fantasy of my father, out of the hatred he holds for him.~
@918  = ~(Snort!) Are you mad? The proof of his guiltiness is *exactly* the lack of proof! Saerk worries himself about not leaving any traces! He did the same with me!~
@919  = ~I... I won't let my sister's loss obfuscate my judgment. Such a vengeance, called upon by unproved assumptions, is against the Order's dictates, and I will not follow such a road.~
@920  = ~You... You lied to me! You told me we'd punish that evil man, and you turned back on your own word!~
@921  = ~Enough! I took my decision and won't rethink it! Your past with that man is no concern of mine!~
@922  = ~I curse you, Anomen! You denied my just vengeance for your own whim! I will never forgive you this!~
@923  = ~I have nothing to do with your shrieking, halfling. Now go, before I lose my temper!~
@924  = ~(Snort!) So be it, Anomen. If that's what you wish, I'll be gone. Seeing your ugly face makes me mad!~
@925  = ~You're making a mistake, Stivan. The responsible of your sorrows might be the same, but the results would be different. If Anomen avenged murder with murder, he'd commit a crime unforgivable for the Order. The same doesn't hold for you.~
@926  = ~Calm down, Stivan. The situation is complex, but you won't achieve anything by leaving or demanding vengeance.~
@927  = ~Try to be reasonable, Stivan, Stivan. Your problem cannot influence somebody else's problem. They must be distinct. Anomen cannot avenge a wrongdoing that isn't his own, or the consequences would fall on him.~
@928  = ~What about me? Don't you think about me?~
@929  = ~*SOB*! Mommy always said that it is impossible not to cry in the face of injustice, and she was right! You back him up, and that hurts me even more than his decision not to help me!~
@930  = ~My travels with you end here, <CHARNAME>. I thought we were friends, but your words showed me I was wrong. Goodbye!~
@931  = ~As an insidious mass of black clouds goes away after the storm, so Faldorn's menace has been avoided forever.~
@932  = ~Yet, it appears that Nature is unjustly accused of another crime. Am I right, Stivan?~
@933  = ~What's this, are you trying to socialize? Sorry, but I have no intention of wasting my breath on you.~
@934  = ~As a druid, it is my duty to intervene to restore Balance and open your eyes to the light of truth. Along our path you will mature, and together we will give sense and meaning to your tragedies.~
@935  = ~(Snort!) There's no reason to use such ridiculous talk to call me immature! I'm not stupid, and I can recognize an insult!~
@936  = ~Every creation of the Mother is or was immature. Are there bulbs that never grow into a flower? Or trees that don't yield fruits?~
@937  = ~Shut your mouth, druid! Shut up!~
@938  = ~Soon we'll begin our walk. Very soon.~
@939  = ~Heh. It looks like the clouds came back, druid, only to hover around your head. The hot potato you have between your hands will stop you from bothering me with your pathetic thoughts, I hope?~
@940  = ~You're wrong. I can't let my personal life interfere with my duty as a druid. Our path begins now.~
@941  = ~Oh, no!~
@942  = ~Let us examine the event that marked the beginning of your war against seagulls. Let us recount, second my second, what happened to you, as if we were sorting through a flower's petals.~
@943  = ~(Snort!) You're abusing my patience! Who do you believe you are, to demand I tell you of my family's murder?~
@944  = ~Do not mistake my attempt at truth as presumption. At the moment you are sailing through the waters of ignorance, and it is my duty to ensure that the winds of destiny move your ship towards the ocean of knowledge.~
@945  = ~I know what you are getting at. You... you dare deny the seagulls' guiltiness!~
@946  = ~Simple sea birds could never commit a crime like the murder of an innocent family. It is not their nature.~
@947  = ~Then they must have fallen victims to predatory instincts that day, since I saw them feast with my relatives' corpses!~
@948  = ~Exactly, Stivan. You say that you saw them eat, not while they were killing your parents and brothers.~
@949  = ~... Don't try to confuse me with meandering word games. It was seagulls who killed them and desecrated their bodies! It was them!~
@950  = ~The seed of doubt has been cast, and it will grow roots with time.~
@951  = ~Doubt is painted on your face, Stivan.~
@952  = ~I imagine I should thank you for that.~
@953  = ~I can't help to avoid the birds of anxiety and worry to fly around your head, but I'll do what I can to avoid them building a nest of fear in there.~
@954  = ~You could have avoided that one!~
@955  = ~I actually think it represents precisely what you are feeling. You're considering the possibility that the Mother's creatures aren't guilty of your family's death, and this terrifies you.~
@956  = ~(Snort!) If it wasn't seagulls who killed my relatives, then who murdered them? More importantly, *why*?~
@957  = ~That's what I wanted to hear, Stivan. The first step of our path has been reached.~
@958  = ~Might I ask what are you hoping to achieve with these delirious conversations, aside from confusing me?~
@959  = ~You just understood that, behind anything, there is hidden a multitude of possibilities. You considered again a truth you held as absolute, thought about another possibility, and reached the conclusion that you have no definite answer for the moment.~
@960  = ~The path to our second step is open.~
@961  = ~(Gasp!) This place... Is a colony of the feathered enemy!~
@962  = ~Seagulls nest in marine places like beaches, isles or coasts, so it is natural that they're numerous here.~
@963  = ~They have a ferocious glare!~
@964  = ~To tell the truth, Athkatlan seagulls are more aggressive, which is easy to understand. The continuous building in the Docks is destroying their habitat, to the point that they're forced to build their nests even on the top of houses far from the sea.~
@965  = ~There's all kinds of them!~
@966  = ~That's true. That one is a coral seagull, known for the ease with which it nests on steep terrain. Do you see that one? It's a rosy seagull, easily spotted in saltier waters.~
@967  = ~And, at last...~
@968  = ~The one perched on my shoulder is a seagull of the most common variety. Would you like to ask him anything?~
@969  = ~Did you go mad, Cernd?~
@970  = ~Come on; I'll translate for you.~
@971  = ~Well... I mean, I... have no idea...~
@972  = ~Any question you might have will be good.~
@973  = ~Okay, okay.~
@974  = ~*Ahem* Are you a male... or a female?~
@975  = ~He's a male. He's waiting for his companion's eggs to open.~
@976  = ~Come on, take a closer look.~
@977  = ~Are you joking? He'll put a hole in my face!~
@978  = ~He won't, Stivan. He has no reason to be hostile.~
@979  = ~Heh. After all... He as a friendly face.~
@980  = ~Come on, continue. After all, I have a friend to save and a wizard to kill, but what do I care?~
@981  = ~Stivan, are you feeling well?~
@982  = ~I can hardly believe it, Cernd. You ended his hate against seagulls!~
@983  = ~"And that was how the halfling ended his hate against the feathered enemy". I could write a book about this, eh?~
@984  = ~Wh...~
@985  = ~What the hell is going on? What is this ugly bird doing in front of my face? Shoo, shoo!~
@986  = ~No!~
@987  = ~(Gasp!) I was about to fall to the feathered enemy!~
@988  = ~Seagulls! They surrounded us! Attack!!~
@989  = ~(Sigh) <CHARNAME>, you... You just made my efforts useless. I know you weren't doing so on purpose and don't want to blame you, but I'd ask you not to interfere in the future.~
@990  = ~As a fellow servant of Nature, I expect you to understand how important is it to defend these creatures against the bitter anger of Stivan. If our walk proceeds without interruptions, he'll be soon educated to Balance and the respect of the creatures of the Mother, as it should be.~
@991  = ~You aren't a servant of Nature, so I don't expect you to understand how important is it to defend these creatures against the bitter anger of Stivan. If our walk proceeds without interruptions, he'll be soon educated to Balance and the respect of the creatures of the Mother, as it should be.~
@992  = ~I can't believe you killed the only friendly drow in this place!~
@993  = ~The seagulls you kill are equally friendly, and similar cries come to my ears every time you kill one.~
@994  = ~I liked him. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for having spared him no matter the risk.~
@995  = ~As <CHARNAME> risked so much just to spare a life, shouldn't you spare seagulls' life in the same way?~
@996  = ~I look forward to returning to the surface! Ready the fire, <CHARNAME>, tonight I'm off hunting and then we'll have seagull stew for everybody!~
@997  = ~It is in man's nature to kill to eat. However, I doubt that is the real goal of your killings.~
@998  = ~Mind your own matters, Cernd!~
@999  = ~Nature is my own matter, as is the teaching of respect for Her.~
@1000 = ~It is time to continue our walk.~
@1001 = ~No, it isn't!~
@1002 = ~Tell me, Stivan, when did your parents die?~
@1003 = ~They died eight years ago, and I remember it as clear as yesterday!~
@1004 = ~And who killed them?~
@1005 = ~What sort of questions are you asking? It was a storm of seagulls, and you know it better than me!~
@1006 = ~Let us assume that that be true - well, know that seagulls never reach the age of three.~
@1007 = ~Even if you killed all the seagulls that live today, you would never kill the ones you believe killed your parents.~
@1008 = ~I...~
@1009 = ~Tell what you're thinking, even if you're afraid of doing so.~
@1010 = ~I will get my vengeance by killing their children! And the children of their children! And...~
@1011 = ~As the plant's roots eat the hardest of rocks with just the strength of patience, so my teachings will eat your hatred. We sowed enough for today.~
@1012 = ~Your first conversation with a seagull was abruptly interrupted.~
@1013 = ~Here, this is a red-headed seagull, knowing for tying itself for life to his relatives - ties stronger than those between human relatives. Do you have any questions for him, Stivan?~
@1014 = ~Well, I...~
@1015 = ~Don't hesitate, Stivan. Only by talking with your enemy you will know him and end your conflict.~
@1016 = ~(Snort!) I'll do it, on condition that you shut up once I'm done.~
@1017 = ~Now... Are you male or female?~
@1018 = ~She's a female. She left her children in the care of their father and is looking for food.~
@1019 = ~Ah, really? And where do you look for it, by killing babies in their cribs? Or do you prefer to attack grown men?~
@1020 = ~Why is he running? Is he shamed by his sins?~
@1021 = ~(sigh) He said he cannot forage near where men live, because of the Hunter. He must have recognized you.~
@1022 = ~Yeah! My reputation is spreading! Soon Athkatla will be free of the menace!~
@1023 = ~As the darkest hour is the one before dawn, so hatred is strongest before peace. Our path is nearing its end.~
@1024 = ~Cernd, could you attract another seagull? I know what I should tell him.~
@1025 = ~I see that our seeds are flowering. I'll satisfy your request right away.~
@1026 = ~Here. This black-tailed seagull traveled far and wide in his life - he usually nests in the remote lands of Halruaa. It is extremely long-lived, some members of its race live up to fifty years.~
@1027 = ~You lied to me! When you told that seagulls never reach three years old, you lied to me!~
@1028 = ~It could have been him who killed my family!~
@1029 = ~Lying isn't evil if it is done with good goals.~
@1030 = ~Shut up! I don't want to hear you!~
@1031 = ~As Nature forgives the lion for his killings, might the Great Mother forgive me for this inadmissible error. I hope that the seeds we sowed this far will be stronger than this mistake.~
@1032 = ~Cernd, I'm sorry for having attacked you. If you lied to me, it was only with good intentions.~
@1033 = ~I thank you for your understanding.~
@1034 = ~Now tel---~
@1035 = ~*splash*~
@1036 = ~In my face, you ugly bird? Then you want war! Com here and I'll deplume you, and your friend too!~
@1037 = ~As an icy morning doesn't kill the healthy bulb, so the seeds of pity you hold won't be killed by this incident. Flowering is almost upon you.~
@1038 = ~Are you ready, Stivan? We're about to reach the last step in our long walk. I would have never imagined that you reached its conclusion here in Hell, but if such is the will of destiny, I won't fight it.~
@1039 = ~Must we, Cernd? This place... it frightens me.~
@1040 = ~As <CHARNAME> is going through tests that will bring him to question himself and his role, it vitally important that you do the same.~
@1041 = ~Let us recount the stepping stones we reached during our path.~
@1042 = ~Tell me, Stivan: do you know who ended your family's lives~
@1043 = ~*Ahem* No.~
@1044 = ~Wasn't it done by seagulls?~
@1045 = ~It wasn't them, Cernd. That I already understood.~
@1046 = ~Will you leave the mystery of their death unsolved?~
@1047 = ~I might never know who caused their deaths, but I can't stay tied to the past. I ignored the present far too much, and I understood it is time to look up to the future. I understood that when I put my relatives' ashes in the crypt.~
@1048 = ~What lies in wait for you now?~
@1049 = ~Heh. That's a good question.~
@1050 = ~This is not enough of an answer to me.~
@1051 = ~Cernd, we're in hell. I must still understands if I'm alive or dead!~
@1052 = ~Imagine a day when the trees caress you with their green leaves; a tomorrow where spring writes in the air the delirious alphabet of cyclic time, as dawn grows primulas and tulips all around you. Would you see yourself in such a place?~
@1053 = ~I think I'll have an allergic fever the first days, but I can imagine myself living in such a place.~
@1054 = ~One last question.~
@1055 = ~I have an head ache, Cernd. I've never thought this long in my life.~
@1056 = ~We're almost done. What do you think of life?~
@1057 = ~Heh. This is hard. A little help?~
@1058 = ~The answer is yours.~
@1059 = ~Well, I... Until some time ago, I would have told you it is the harshest of battlefields; now, instead, I think it is as stage where everybody acts his own role.~
@1060 = ~And would you be willing to pick up a copy of the play?~
@1061 = ~I think so.~
@1062 = ~Very well, Stivan. There's nothing else to say. The goal of our path has been reached. Might the Mother's, Chauntea, and the Father's, Silvanus, wisdom guide you towards what lies in wait for you.~
@1063 = ~... Could I tell you one thing, Cernd?~
@1064 = ~Certainly.~
@1065 = ~Your hair is longer than vines. Could I shorten them a bit?~
@1066 = ~We should help <CHARNAME> rescue the Tears of Bhaal and his soul. After that... we shall see.~
@1067 = ~Here we are! It has bee long since I put my furry feet in this place. Samuel, the halfling I mentioned, is there at the counter. Let us greet him.~
@1068 = ~Greetings, my good friends, and well... Stivan! It has been far too long since I last saw you! I was wondering where you ended up.~
@1069 = ~Hey there, Samuel! I'm sorry if I don't come and say 'hi' as frequently as before, but I'm traveling with a party of adventurers, and we're always busy in some heroic task and the like.~
@1070 = ~Oho! This is good news! Finally Tymora smiles on you!~
@1071 = ~I would have gifted you the boots I used to wear when I traveled along the Sword Coast, but I already gave them to sweet Mazzy.~
@1072 = ~Remember, treat my favorite paladin right.~
@1073 = ~*Ahem* Sure, Samuel. She and I get on very nicely.~
@1074 = ~Uhm... Is there something between you two?~
@1075 = ~Between me and the potato peddler? Are you mad?~
@1076 = ~If she hears you call her that, Stivan, she'll make you rethink that.~
@1077 = ~Heh. I'll try to hold myself, then.~
@1078 = ~If you wait a second, I have a surprise for you. Don't run away!~
@1079 = ~If it is so, let me find the boots I used to wear when I traveled along the Sword Coast. You'll need them more than me. Now, where did I put them...? Ah, here they are. Take them. I hope they fit you nicely.~
@1080 = ~Wow! Thank you, Samuel. You're really kind.~
@1081 = ~Hey, they fit me perfectly!~
@1082 = ~I had no doubts. If you wait another second, I have another surprise for you. Don't run away!~
@1083 = ~Very well, we'll wait for you.~
@1084 = ~Have you seen how kind he is, <CHARNAME>? He helped me a lot after my parents' and brothers' death.~
@1085 = ~It is obvious how much you hold him in high esteem.~
@1086 = ~I heard that halflings greatly help each other, and this is proof of that.~
@1087 = ~What surprise do you think he holds?~
@1088 = ~How did he help you?~
@1089 = ~I don't know. We can't but wait and see.~
@1090 = ~This dear family friend was the only one to give me a shoulder to lean on after that meanie Saerk did the ugly things I told you about.~
@1091 = ~When my parents and brothers were killed by seagulls, I asked my father's partner for help. I had no idea how to run my inheritance, and thought he of all people could help me.~
@1092 = ~Samuel offered to house me here, in the Five Flagons, but when I started my just crusade against seagulls I had to leave. Some customers didn't like the sight of seagulls being tortured, and I didn't want to ruin Samuel's business, not after all he had done for me.~
@1093 = ~This explains everything. He is really a nice person.~
@1094 = ~Perhaps it could have been wiser to ask him rather than your father's partner for help, don't you think?~
@1095 = ~Couldn't you have stopped killing those poor birds? At least you'd have had a roof over your head.~
@1096 = ~(Snort!) It's easy to judge after the fact, <CHARNAME>! Nothing could let me imagine that such a thing could have happened!~
@1097 = ~Heh. I love you when you try to be funny.~
@1098 = ~Here I am - I'm sorry for the wait!~
@1099 = ~But that... That is...~
@1100 = ~Yes! It's one of the last bottles of your family's wine. I hold them as dear as a treasure, but I say that we should drink one to celebrate your career as an adventurer!~
@1101 = ~(Sniff) Thanks, Samuel. I'm moved...~
@1102 = ~Oh, don't cry. It'd be a shame if your salty tears tainted a glass of exceptional wine. Here, take this: one for you, and one for your friend.~
@1103 = ~Come on, <CHARNAME>, have a drink. I'm sure you'll love it!~
@1104 = ~Er... I'm afraid I'm abstemious...~
@1105 = ~Thank you, but I really don't like wine.~
@1106 = ~I love wine, especially red one. Stivan, Samuel, cheers!~
@1107 = ~Really? What a shame. Only I and Samuel will celebrate, then. Cheers, my friend!~
@1108 = ~Cheers!~
@1109 = ~Simply divine!~
@1110 = ~Samuel, would you please get a move on?! Why do you stand there talking while I'm killing myself running between tables?~
@1111 = ~Er... Duty calls, friends. I must really go, but come back soon!~
@1112 = ~You can count on it, Samuel! Thanks for everything and be well!~
@1113 = ~... Thanks to you as well, <CHARNAME>. This stop really cheered me up, and now I feel ready to get back to adventuring with red cheeks. Heh.~
@1114 = ~You know, <CHARNAME>, I'm really happy that you asked me to travel with you. I won't suffer hunger no more, and will find a place where my relatives will be able to rest in peace. I haven't felt this upbeat in years, now!~
@1115 = ~Have you always been poor, Stivan?~
@1116 = ~But I thought you enjoyed selling plumes.~
@1117 = ~I'm happy to know this. Your knowledge of the city is unmatched.~
@1118 = ~Great. Let us continue our march with courage, then.~
@1119 = ~Oh no. I once lived in much better conditions!~
@1120 = ~*Ahem* selling plumes was an odd job I had to do to survive. I vastly preferred my old life.~
@1121 = ~Heh. My knowledge isn't limited to Amn's capital, you know? I've been in far more places, and let me tell you why.~
@1122 = ~Yeah! Let's go!~
@1123 = ~Ah, One last thing. When you want to rest, we could go to the Five Flagon Inn in the Bridge District and drink some good wine. The owner is an halfling like me, although I'm very much friendlier. Heh.~
@1124 = ~My family have owned some vineyards right outside Athkatla for many generations. My father's partner handled the farming, while we handled the selling of the end product: a peerless wine!~
@1125 = ~Every year, after the wine-making season, my brothers and I set off with daddy to sell our flasks, while mommy stayed home and sold some bottles to the local merchants. Once we came back, we divided our money with the Farrahds.~
@1126 = ~So you're an expert as far as wines go, right?~
@1127 = ~Did you always walk the same routes, or did you change them every year?~
@1128 = ~I haven't understood if you lived in the country or in the city.~
@1129 = ~It was a very interesting story. However, we must get back to our duties.~
@1130 = ~Exactly. All thanks to daddy!~
@1131 = ~A bit of both. We always stopped by the most well-paying places, while we changed around the other towns, to seek the best markets.~
@1132 = ~We lived in the city, in a small house in the Bridge District. We had a big house in the country, for all the peasants who worked for us.~
@1133 = ~Our life was marked by a calendar of dates that always gave us confidence. Everything was almost cyclic.... At least until the seagulls came.~
@1134 = ~(Snort!) Cursed birds! I go mad just my uttering their names! I still bear the scars of that meeting!~
@1135 = ~Judging by your cuts, you must have had some bad experience in your past. Have you been assaulted by a storm of seagulls?~
@1136 = ~These? They are the result of being tortured by Irenicus, the mage we're hunting.~
@1137 = ~Well, let's see... This one, I received from a kobold in the Nashkel Mines, this one from Sarevok in Baldur’s Gate. Oh, I was forgetting *these*: a gift from Irenicus, the mage who captured and tortured me.~
@1138 = ~No close call with seagulls, luckily. These are simply cuts I received in the last battle. The real scars are those that Irenicus gave my soul while torturing me.~
@1139 = ~Don't change the subject, Stivan. What happened?~
@1140 = ~How could seagulls attack your family? It isn't their nature to be aggressive.~
@1141 = ~(Stivan pulls out of his backpack the urn with the ashes of his close ones). *This* happened.~
@1142 = ~Stavo dicendo: come ti sei procurato quelle cicatrici? Sono forse opera di gabbiani?~
@1143 = ~Poco importa quale sia la loro natura, il risultato è sempre lo stesso!~
@1144 = ~Se l’occhio non mi inganna, le tue cicatrici sembrerebbero proprio opera di gabbiani. Non è forse così?~
@1145 = ~Ti ha torturato? E perché mai?~
@1146 = ~Essere un figlio di Bhaal comporta questo e ben altro.~
@1147 = ~E’ quello che sto cercando di scoprire. Imoen, la ragazza che è stata imprigionata con me, mi ha detto che voleva esplorare il mio potenziale di figlio di Bhaal, anche se non ho idea di cosa questo significhi.~
@1148 = ~Cosa?! Stai scherzando, vero? Mia mamma diceva sempre che le signorine non si toccano neanche con un fiore!~
@1149 = ~E’ quello che dico anch’io.~
@1150 = ~Temo che i genitori di Irenicus non abbiano fatto altrettanto.~
@1151 = ~Er... Non credo che Irenicus conosca la cavalleria...~
@1152 = ~Hai idea del perché ti abbia torturata?~
@1153 = ~Essere una figlia di Bhaal comporta questo e ben altro.~
@1154 = ~E’ quello che sto cercando di scoprire. Imoen, la ragazza che è stata imprigionata con me, mi ha detto che voleva esplorare il mio potenziale di figlia di Bhaal, anche se non ho idea di cosa questo significhi.~
@1155 = ~Bhaal? Ho già sentito questo nome...~
@1156 = ~Ma certo! E’ quel dongiovanni che durante il Periodo dei Disordini seduceva tutte le donne che incontrava sulla sua strada, giusto?~
@1157 = ~Come fai a conoscere quel periodo?~
@1158 = ~Er... Non proprio. Bhaal era una divinità malvagia che, conscia della sua futura caduta, ha lasciato una prole che sperava alimentasse la sua rinascita.~
@1159 = ~Io lo chiamerei “Bhaal: dongiovanni nel tempo libero, Signore dell’Omicidio di professione”.~
@1160 = ~*Ahem* Dall’aspetto non si direbbe, ma io sono più grande di te, sai?~
@1161 = ~Ricordo quegli anni. Papà era preoccupatissimo a causa della scomparsa di Waukeen, la dea del commercio. Temeva che gli affari ne avrebbero risentito, e in effetti per un po’ di tempo fu così.~
@1162 = ~Questo significa che non tu sei un comune <RACE> come gli altri! Vali qualcosa, sotto sotto!~
@1163 = ~E cosa mi dici di tua madre?~
@1164 = ~Non l’ho mai conosciuta. Non so nulla di lei. Né il nome, né l’aspetto... Nulla.~
@1165 = ~Non ho idea di chi sia. Gorion, il mio patrigno, ha sempre evitato l’argomento.~
@1166 = ~Merita solo il mio più profondo disprezzo. Mi ha abbandonato dopo avermi dato alla luce.~
@1167 = ~Accidenti. La storia della tua vita è più complicata delle trame degli spettacoli che danno alla Locanda dei Cinque Boccali. Ci sei mai stato? E’ nel Quartiere del Ponte. Magari lì potremmo continuare a parlare davanti a un buon bicchiere di vino. Il proprietario è un halfling come me, anche se io sono molto più simpatico. Heh.~
@1168 = ~Mi hai parlato di una missione quando ci siamo incontrati per la prima volta, <CHARNAME>, e non posso fare a meno di chiedermi se abbiamo fatto dei progressi ultimamente.~
@1169 = ~Più o meno.~
@1170 = ~Non quanti vorrei. Ora come ora, sto raccogliendo una certa somma di denaro per Gaelan Bayle, il rappresentante di un'organizzazione che mi ha offerto il suo aiuto.~
@1171 = ~Ho due contatti che potrebbero fare al caso mio. Gaelan Bayle, un uomo che ho incontrato poco dopo il mio arrivo ad Athkatla, e una certa "Signora" di cui devo ancora valutare l'offerta.~
@1172 = ~Dubito che andremo avanti se mi interrompi in continuazione. Un pò di silenzio, per favore.~
@1173 = ~Più o meno, eh? D'accordo, vediamo se mi viene in mente qualcuno che possa esserti d'aiuto...~
@1174 = ~Uhmm... Il clero qui in città è molto ricco e potente, ma dubito che i suoi membri si esporrebbero così tanto per uno sconosciuto. Sono troppo impegnati a genuflettersi davanti alle statue dei loro dei e cose simili.~
@1175 = ~Lo stesso dicasi per il Cuore Radioso: a meno che tu non prometta loro una "campagna contro il male" o qualche altra sciocchezza con cui si riempiono la bocca, continueranno a fare gli sbruffoni e a lucidare le loro armature.~
@1176 = ~Altri?~
@1177 = ~Oltre a questi... Non mi vengono in mente altri gruppi abbastanza potenti da prendere per il naso gli Incappucciati. Del resto, stiamo parlando di un'organizzazione potente. Cosa sai di loro?~
@1178 = ~Nulla, in realtà. Lungo la Costa della Spada non sono noti.~
@1179 = ~Sino ad ora ho raccolto veramente poche informazioni. Non riesco a capire se la gente non parli per paura o per semplice ignoranza.~
@1180 = ~So che *non* sono collaborativi. Il loro rappresentante al Palazzo di Giustizia non scuce una sola parola.~
@1181 = ~Anch'io ignoro i dettagli di cui hai bisogno, <CHARNAME>. Qui ad Athkatla si sa poco o nulla degli Incappucciati: sembra quasi che esistano da sempre, ma le cose non stanno così.~
@1182 = ~La mia famiglia abita nella capitale dell'Amn da molte generazioni, pertanto la storia della comparsa di quei maghetti nella nostra città è stata tramandata sino a me e ai miei fratelli.~
@1183 = ~Tuttavia, mentre la maggior parte dei racconti si arricchisce di dettagli col passare di bocca in bocca, questo si è gradualmente impoverito.~
@1184 = ~Stando a quello che mi hanno raccontato i miei genitori, l'enclave degli Stregoni Incappucciati venne fondata circa due secoli fa da un tale di Esmeltaran allo scopo di proteggere la tradizione magica nell'Amn e fermare coloro che avessero abusato della Trama per fare i cattivoni.~
@1185 = ~Nessuno sa chi siano veramente quei maghi, quale sia la loro base e come facciano a trovare immediatamente chiunque utilizzi la magia. Soprattutto, resta un mistero perchè all'improvviso siano diventati così... spregiudicati.~
@1186 = ~Quindi hanno perso il lume della ragione soltanto di recente? Bizzarro. Avrei scommesso che fossero stati fuori di testa sin dalle origini.~
@1187 = ~Sembrerebbe la tipica degenerazione di quanti accumulano troppo potere senza avere la capacità di gestirlo.~
@1188 = ~In effetti il loro operato sarebbe valido e sensato se agissero con più criterio.~
@1189 = ~Il loro atteggiamento è cambiato drasticamente un anno prima della scomparsa dei miei familiari. Vi fu un colpo di stato... Un Incappucciato cercò di prendere il controllo del Consiglio, ma venne scoperto e fatto fuori.~
@1190 = ~Non ricordo altro. Non avevo che uno spruzzo di peli sui piedi e, come forse ti ho già detto, non ho una buona memoria.~
@1191 = ~Cerchiamo di guardare il lato positivo delle cose. Se non ci fossero stati gli Incappucciati, tu ed io non ci saremmo mai incontrati!~
@1192 = ~A cosa segue cosa, giusto. Immagino sia una considerazione a cui debba abituarmi, soprattutto a causa del mio lignaggio.~
@1193 = ~Senza offesa, Stivan, ma avrei fatto volentieri a meno della tua conoscenza se questo avesse significato non perdere Imoen.~
@1194 = ~Non sempre mi riesce di vedere l'altro lato della medaglia, specialmente ora che mi trovo in questa situazione.~
@1195 = ~... Se questa era una battuta, <CHARNAME>, sappi che era tutto fuorchè simpatica.~
@1196 = ~Mia mamma diceva sempre che ciò che dobbiamo imparare a fare lo impariamo facendolo. Gli anni che ho trascorso in strada le hanno dato ragione. Del resto, non si sbagliava mai.~
@1197 = ~In... in che razza di posto ci hai condotti, <CHARNAME>?~
@1198 = ~Da quando siamo qui abbiamo dovuto combattere beholder, mind flayer, e ora demoni! Cos'altro ci aspetta, un drago? Un'esercito di drow?~
@1199 = ~Uhm, presenti esclusi, ovviamente!~
@1200 = ~Hmpf. Sarei tentata di tradirvi e unirmi alla prima pattuglia drow che incontro pur di poterti zittire una volta per sempre, jaluk.~
@1201 = ~Heh. Ti adoro quando hai voglia di scherzare, Viccy!~
@1202 = ~Non mettere a prova la tua buona sorte, piccoletto.~
@1203 = ~Non ho mica scelto io questo luogo! La colpa è di Saemon Havarian!~
@1204 = ~Coraggio. Ho la sensazione che presto saremo di ritorno ad Athkatla.~
@1205 = ~Tu hai paura? A me piace qua. Tre anni di battaglie, e del male non ci sarà altro che il ricordo!~
@1206 = ~Si vede che sei un buon capo - sei sempre svelto a scaricare le colpe sugli altri!~
@1207 = ~Veramente...~
@1208 = ~Guarda che...~
@1209 = ~Di cosa stai...~
@1210 = ~Speriamo...~
@1211 = ~Co-cosa? Tu sei matto!~
@1212 = ~Ooh, sai anche negare l'evidenza - sei proprio tagliato per comandare!~
@1213 = ~Mi raccomando, quando ti eleggono come Consigliere dell'Amn, nomina me come ministro della difesa aerea!~
@1214 = ~Mi sembri a tuo agio in questo posto, Jaheira, come se ti trovassi a casa.~
@1215 = ~In un certo senso lo sono. Ho visto la luce proprio in questa nazione, sebbene in una regione molto più a sud rispetto a dove ci troviamo.~
@1216 = ~Se hai intenzione di farci un salto, ti accompagnerei volentieri. Le strade maestre di questa regione si snodano lungo una catena di piccoli villaggi halfling noti per la qualità del loro artigianato. Mio papà aveva molto a cuore quei posti.~
@1217 = ~L'ora della vendetta non può più essere rimandata, pertanto valuterò questa possibilità in un secondo momento. Ad ogni modo, sarebbe una tappa intermedia di un viaggio molto più lungo.~
@1218 = ~Per dirigerti dove?~
@1219 = ~Penso sia mio dovere andare a Calimshan. Io... Non vorrei, ma sento che è la cosa giusta da fare.~
@1220 = ~A prescindere dalle motivazioni che ti spingono a compiere questo viaggio, ti consiglio di non andarci da sola. Non avevo nessuno al mio fianco quando sono andato a rivedere i vigneti che un tempo appartenevano alla mia famiglia, e ti assicuro che non è stata un'esperienza piacevole.~
@1221 = ~Suppongo sia dipeso dallo spirito con cui vi sei tornato.~
@1222 = ~Era inevitabile che nutrissi alcune aspettative: che quella fattoria, quel sentiero, quegli intrecci di foglie, una volta rivisti, mi ispirassero un particolare sentimento, ma sono rimasto meravigliato quando la sola cosa che ho provato è stata un’improvvisa stilettata di memoria provocata da scenari e ambienti ai quali non avrei mai attribuito un tale potere di ferire.~
@1223 = ~Il luogo in cui vorrei andare ha delle associazioni dolorose, ma farò il possibile perché mi lasci indifferente. Ho intenzione di percorrerlo in lungo e in largo, sbarazzina e risoluta, per poi andarmene non appena avrò ottemperato certe... formalità.~
@1224 = ~Ebbene, direi che abbiamo indugiato abbastanza. Questa conversazione mi ha dato diversi spunti su cui riflettere, e sono piacevolmente sorpresa dalla profondità di quanto hai detto.~
@1225 = ~Heh. L'ho sempre detto che sono sottovalutato.~
@1226 = ~Seguimi, maschio. Appagherai i miei desideri sino a quando ne avrò voglia!~
@1227 = ~(Arrossisce) Mia mamma diceva sempre che certe cose si fanno solo da sposati...~
@1228 = ~Cosa diavolo stai blaterando?~
@1229 = ~Lui appartiene a me, femmina. Fatti da parte, o assaggerai la mia ira.~
@1230 = ~Perdonami, sorella. Non sapevo fosse di tua proprietà.~
@1231 = ~... Quella donna voleva appropriarsi della mia innocenza!~
@1232 = ~E' proprio per questo che sono intervenuta. *LE* ho risparmiato un fato invero terribile.~
@1233 = ~Abbassa il tuo sguardo al mio cospetto, maschio!~
@1234 = ~Se abbasso la testa, come faccio a vedere dove vado?~
@1235 = ~Osi contraddirmi?! Le Ancelle della Regina dei Ragni ti strapperanno il cuore per questo affronto!~
@1236 = ~Non c'è bisogno di scomodarle. Punirò io questo insolente.~
@1237 = ~Lascio a te il piacere, femmina. Possano i tentacoli della tua verga affondare nella carne di quel verme!~
@1238 = ~... Me la sono vista brutta. Grazie, Jaheira.~
@1239 = ~Presta attenzione a ciò che dici e a come ti comporti, Stivan. In futuro potrei non riuscire ad aiutarti.~
@1240 = ~Tu, laggiù. Sembri dotato, per essere un maschio di Ched Nasad. Avanti, seguimi nei miei alloggi.~
@1241 = ~Io, ah... Devo svolgere dei compiti per la Matrona. Compiti di fondamentale importanza.~
@1242 = ~Non abusare della mia pazienza, miserabile! Ti aspetterò presso la Società delle Femmine Guerriere, e farai bene a non tardare!~
@1243 = ~Sì, mia signora. Sarò da voi... non appena possibile.~
@1244 = ~Cos... Chi ha osato lanciarmi in faccia una simile schifezza? Chi?! Se trovo il responsabile di questo affronto lo getterò nella Fossa dei Ragni!~
@1245 = ~Heh. La cacca di gabbiano non perdona.~
@1246 = ~Per Yondalla! Cosa ci fa un mezzopelo in un quartiere pericoloso come i Bassifondi?~
@1247 = ~Questa zona è una delle più pericolose della città, è vero, ma ti assicuro che so badare a me stesso.~
@1248 = ~Ehi! Dov’è finita la mia pagnotta?!~
@1249 = ~(Gnamm!) Non... Non ho visto nulla!~
@1250 = ~Ciao, piccolino. Mi venderesti qualche piuma?~
@1251 = ~Certo, Rose. Il solito?~
@1252 = ~Questa volta facciamo solo cinque. Purtroppo ho perso alcuni dei clienti che impazzivano quando le usavo per certi giochetti erotici.~
@1253 = ~(Arrossisce) Non... Non voglio sapere altro. Ecco, a te.~
@1254 = ~Sei proprio delizioso quando arrossisci in quel modo. Ci vediamo, tesoruccio.~
@1255 = ~Uhmmm... Il tuo sguattero sembra decisamente ossequioso, Nalia. Sei disposta a vendermelo?~
@1256 = ~Non so a chi vi stiate riferendo, Lord Ophal. Non ho bisogno di viaggiare con la servitù di casa.~
@1257 = ~Stai dicendo che quella creatura non è alle tue dipendenze?~
@1258 = ~Stivan il Cacciatore esegue ogni desiderio di Miss Nalia!~
@1259 = ~E' addirittura capace di parlare. Sono pronto a farti un'ottima offerta, mia diletta. Dieci monete d'oro vanno bene?~
@1260 = ~Wow! Non pensavo di valere così tanto!~
@1261 = ~Vi suggerisco di andarvene, Lord Ophal. Non mi interessa il vostro sporco denaro, e non tratto le persone come bestiame destinato alla vendita.~
@1262 = ~Che peccato. Sarebbe stato un ottimo affare.~
@1263 = ~Nalia... Nel mio circolo si vocifera da tempo che fossi decaduta, ma i pettegolezzi non rendono l'idea della tua miseria.~
@1264 = ~Siete tale e uguale a vostra figlia, Miss Tandolan, se non peggio. Ad ogni modo, non mi interessa ciò che dite su di me nei vostri salotti.~
@1265 = ~Ma certo, cara. Tornatene tra gli zingari a cui ormai appartieni.~
@1266 = ~La vera nobiltà non deriva dalla nascita, ma dalle proprie azioni. Il massimo a cui potete aspirare è il titolo di bruttona tra le bruttone, sapete?~
@1267 = ~Come osi, mostriciattolo! Potrei farti arrestare dalle mie guardie per una simile infamia!~
@1268 = ~Quali guardie? Quelle che i Ladri Tenebrosi si vantano di aver raggirato un'infinità di volte?~
@1269 = ~Non... Non finisce qui! Vi siete appena fatti una nemica!~
@1270 = ~... Ti ringrazio, Stivan. Sei stato molto gentile.~
@1271 = ~Heh. Non potevo fare diversamente. Questa era una delle volte in cui tacere diventa una colpa e parlare diventa un obbligo.~
