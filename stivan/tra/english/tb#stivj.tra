@0    = ~(Gasp!)~
@1    = ~Safe... by a straw!~
@2    = ~<CHARNAME>, the urn containing my close ones was about to fall out of my backpack! You promised me you'd help me find somewhere safe to stash it, so... Let's find that somewhere, please!~
@3    = ~Uhm?~
@4    = ~There's something wrong. My pack feels strange.~
@5    = ~I made sure to put everything in perfect balance, but...~
@6    = ~Eeekkk! Eeeekkkk! EEEEEKKKKK!~
@7    = ~Is everything all right, Stivan?~
@8    = ~By the gods, halfling! Could you stop screaming like that?~
@9    = ~You'll put your things in place next stop. We don't have time to waste on that now~
@10   = ~My... My urn! It's in pieces! Shattered!~
@11   = ~*SOB*! My... My dear ones... scattered to the wind... like this...~
@12   = ~It... It's all your fault, <CHARNAME>! You promised me that we'd stash it somewhere safe, and you completely forgot about my only demand!~
@13   = ~I imagine it broke during the last battle. I'm sorry, Stivan.~
@14   = ~You're right. I completely forgot about it. Let's get to it now!~
@15   = ~Try to be understanding. There are so many things I have to take care of...~
@16   = ~(Snort!) Shut up! Your excuses are nothing! My relatives' memory is forever tainted, and it's all your fault!~
@17   = ~I... Have no intention to fight for you any longer. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>! Might the seagulls feast on your vile bodies!~
@18   = ~Looking for a tomb.

While we were exploring the Bridge District we found Stivan, an halfling native of Athkatla, whom I asked for help in my search of Imoen and Irenicus. In exchange for a tomb where he might put the ashes of his close ones, Stivan offered us his guidance in his town and his defense against... er... seagulls. The halfling said I should go in the Government District and ask some clerk in the Council of Six.~
@19   = ~Looking for a tomb.

The clerk in the Council of Six Building has started the procedures required to make Stivan properly acquire the tomb. He promised he will send for us as soon as he is done, and also offered to keep the urn safe in the meantime.~
@20   = ~Looking for a tomb.

A clerk in the Council of Six Building explained us that there are currently no free tombs. However, he also mentioned that there is one where no one dares to tread because of voices about its inhabitant. Not scared by such tales, I decided to explore it: after cleaning it of any trouble I might find, in fact, we'd be free to claim it for Stivan's relatives..~
@21   = ~Looking for a tomb.

A messenger informed us that the documents for the transferal of the crypt are ready. I can go pick them up any time I wish from the clerk Lawrence in the Council of Six building.~
@22   = ~Looking for a tomb.

The urn containing the ashes of the Stivan's family broke before I could find a proper tomb for it. The halfling, furious, left the party.~
@23   = ~(Sigh) It doesn't seem real. I'm about to leave this urn behind. I'm about to give the final goodbye to my family...~
@24   = ~Come on, Stivan. Be strong.~
@25   = ~You aren't changing your mind, are you? I'd feel *slightly* disappointed if you decided to keep it with you.~
@26   = ~It's not a final goodbye. As long as the deceased live in our memories, they don't really die.~
@27   = ~It is just that the dead rest in peace. You can't imagine how much I would have wanted to properly bury Gorion...~
@28   = ~I didn't change my mind, <CHARNAME>, It's just...~
@29   = ~This *is* a final goodbye, <CHARNAME>! I... I lived too long trapped in the sorrow over my family's death! I... must go on!~
@30   = ~I... understand that your foster father's death was harsh on you, and that you wish you could have buried him, but...~
@31   = ~Do you think it easy? Do you think it easy to forever leave those that loved you behind? As soon as I leave their remains here, I... I will be alone!~
@32   = ~This is not true. You have many friends around you, me included.~
@33   = ~Your family disappeared many years ago, Stivan, not now.  All you're doing now is leaving their remains where they should have been for all this time.~
@34   = ~We're all alone. Use this experience to learn how to live for yourself.~
@35   = ~Are you telling me that that urn kept you company for all these years? No offense, friend, but this is silly. You have nothing but a silent object in your hands.~
@36   = ~(You see Stivan's eyes fill with tears).~
@37   = ~Oh, no. I beg you, don't cry. I can't comfort people...~
@38   = ~Let go, my friend. Cry as much as you wish.~
@39   = ~Men never cry, Stivan. Dry your eyes, come on.~
@40   = ~So even men cry. Surprising.~
@41   = ~(Stivan explodes in tears, holding you close). *SOB*!~
@42   = ~(The halfling cries for many minutes, holding your venter in his arms. You hear him whisper something).~
@43   = ~Mommy...~
@44   = ~ (You stay silent).~
@45   = ~ (You hold him close).~
@46   = ~Shh... It's all right.~
@47   = ~Leave me, Stivan. You're making me uneasy.~
@48   = ~Daddy...~
@49   = ~(After some moments, the halfling slowly leaves your embrace, drying the tears that wet his face).~
@50   = ~Heh. It'd be better if I hurried up.~
@51   = ~Looking for a tomb.

We finally managed to leave the ashes of Stivan's familiars in the crypt. To thank me, he gifted me his "most precious treasure", a strange red plume taken from a seagull.~
@52   = ~(The halfling abruptly leaves you, drying the tears that wet his face).~
@53   = ~(Snort!) Your heart is colder than stone!~
@54   = ~(Stivan runs to the end of the crypt and puts the urn inside the chest. He also puts something else near the container).~
@55   = ~Mommy... Daddy... Brothers... Goodbye.~
@56   = ~(Sniff) One day Minsc will properly bury sweet Dynaheir as well. Her resting place will be so majestic that hamsters will rush from all over Faerun to honor her!~
@57   = ~I don't understand why townspeople feel the need to bury the dead in such restrictive places. Nature offers many a place that would be better for this task.~
@58   = ~Tombs aren't mere holding places for the bodies of the dead. They are also needed to comfort the soul of those who remain alive.~
@59   = ~Now that you put the physical weight of your tragedy behind, our walk nears its end. The last mile awaits us.~
@60   = ~I-I'm... I'm happy for you, Stivan...~
@61   = ~Might nobody disturb your eternal rest, halfling friends.~
@62   = ~I appreciate the essentiality of your last goodbyes with them, Stivan. You should be taken as example by all those nobles that waste treasures in needlessly wealthy funeral rites.~
@63   = ~Really moving. Had I a heart, I'd be crying.~
@64   = ~Ahh... Life is the most boring of adventures. It always ends the same way.~
@65   = ~Will you keep going like this for much more, sakphul?~
@66   = ~I haven't seen many things in my life, but death is the one I saw the most often.~
@67   = ~I can never recall: is it bad form to tell licentious stories during a funeral?~
@68   = ~I... I... I'm sorry, Stivan. I don't know what else to say...~
@69   = ~Hmph. I hate these melodramatic moments. Does anyone want to go bash someone in the head?~
@70   = ~We're all peers before death, so... if you were just, might Torm accept you in His house.~
@71   = ~Might the light of Helm guide their souls to peace.~
@72   = ~It might be trite to express condolences in these moments, but know that I understand your loss better than anyone else.~
@73   = ~*Ahem* You should know, <CHARNAME>, that the chest is trapped to avoid looters disturbing my loved ones. Whomever would be fool enough to mess with it, he'd be drowned in seagull poo and plumes. Diabolic, eh?~
@74   = ~To thank you for the help, I want to gift you something. Here: my most precious treasure.~
@75   = ~It's a red plume. I found it some time ago while depluming a seagull. Really strange, since they are exclusively white, possibly with some black or gray spots.~
@76   = ~Speaking about seagulls, I think I heard one. Could they be besting even here in the Graveyard District?! Let's rush out and check!~
@77   = ~Eeeekkkk! That wasn't a seagull!~
@78   = ~Damn you... You violated our Lord's tomb!~
@79   = ~Death awaits you!~
@80   = ~<CHARNAME>, don't you think Yoshimo has been nervous lately?~
@81   = ~Nervous? I think he's as cautious and through as usual.~
@82   = ~Yes, I saw that too. Maybe he's worried about meeting Irenicus face to face.~
@83   = ~No, I wouldn't say so. What makes you think that?~
@84   = ~I don't know. Yoshi has always been calm and sure of himself. Lately, though, he's been tense.~
@85   = ~Imoen and I weren't the only ones to be imprisoned by Irenicus. Yoshimo suffered from the same, but we still don't know why.~
@86   = ~You know Yoshimo... He always becomes unsure when danger looms close.~
@87   = ~I'm not really relaxed myself. I'm worried for Imoen's fate. I hope she's in no danger.~
@88   = ~Why should he worry him?~
@89   = ~The wizard that awaits us is a dangerous person. *Really* dangerous. His spells are really deadly - I felt them on my own skin.~
@90   = ~Danger is around the corner, Stivan. Do you think the Cowlies will welcome us with outstretched arms?~
@91   = ~Really? He never told me so.~
@92   = ~And if he were... If he were a Bhaalspawn as well? That'd explain everything, no?~
@93   = ~You might be right, after all. That'd explain his being imprisoned~
@94   = ~I doubt it is so. Even Minsc and Jaheira were captured, but they don't share my divine birth.~
@95   = ~I don't think my father went as far as Kara-Tur, although it is possible he stopped there to taste the local variety.~
@96   = ~Heh. As you can see, hunting seagulls improved my intuition. We'll soon see if I'm right!~
@97   = ~Bah... I can't wrap my head around this. I'll kill some seagull to get things straight.~
@98   = ~Eeeekkkk! You didn't tell me we were in danger! I worry for my skin, you know?~
@99   = ~Yoshimo! Yoshimo!! I don't want to become a bunch of ashes! You... you still have to teach me how to use a katana properly!~
@100  = ~Calm down, Stivan. I'm not worried. I'm sure that <CHARNAME> will be ready for whatever danger awaits for us. Isn't that so?~
@101  = ~You can be sure of it, my friend.~
@102  = ~Exactly. We'll see this obstacle through as well, together.~
@103  = ~Er... Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'll do as much as possible, but I still remain a <RACE>.~
@104  = ~We should continue, then. There's no point in wasting time.~
@105  = ~Fear is for those of no confidence, and you're not one of those. I don't think you hesitated when...~
@106  = ~EEEEEKKKKK!~
@107  = ~... It would be best if I calmed down our little halfling, before his screaming attracts too much attention. Lead the way, <CHARNAME>.~
@108  = ~*SOB*! <CHARNAME>... <CHARNAME>, why did Yoshimo do that? Why did he betray us?~
@109  = ~I have no idea. Yet it happened.~
@110  = ~Damn traitor! Might he burn in the flames of the abyss!~
@111  = ~It would be better if I didn't know. I lost my soul because of him and I risked losing all of you as well!~
@112  = ~There must be a reasonable explanation, although I can't imagine it yet. He stayed next to me for all this time...~
@113  = ~Io... Don't know what to think. Could it have all been calculated? Is it possible that every talk we shared, every battle we fought, every trap he disarmed... would lead to this? To betraying us?~
@114  = ~No. I think... I think it was all the work of that Irenicus. It was him to forced him to act!~
@115  = ~Everybody is free of choosing, Stivan. Yoshimo chose on his own on whose side he was, so he has no excuses.~
@116  = ~Had he told me he was under a Geas, *maybe* I could have solved that problem, don't you think?!~
@117  = ~Why are you defending him? Must I assume you are allied with that monster too?~
@118  = ~This matters no longer. Yoshimo is dead, and his reasons with him.~
@119  = ~...~
@120  = ~... Damn, I don't know how to think through this. I really cared for Yoshimo and I'm sorry he's dead, especially because he sounded truly regretful. But what you say is true. His choice could have been deadly to all of us. We all seriously risked our lives.~
@121  = ~*Maybe* you should ask yourself why he didn't do that.~
@122  = ~(Snort!) Don't be paranoid, <CHARNAME>! I have nothing to share with that wizard!~
@123  = ~I'd... I'd like to keep Yoshi's blade.~
@124  = ~Why? It would be useless. He was the only one that could ever wield it.~
@125  = ~Forget about it. I don't want to hold anything to remind me of that traitor.~
@126  = ~As you wish. It's all yours.~
@127  = ~Don't ask me why, <CHARNAME>. I don't know as well.~
@128  = ~His katana will be in my hands, not yours.~
@129  = ~I saw you take his... his heart *SOB*! What do you wish to do with it?~
@130  = ~I'll try to remove the Geas that Irenicus cast on him, so that he might rest in peace.~
@131  = ~I don't know. I'm still confused, but something told me to do so.~
@132  = ~He prayed to Ilmater before attacking. Maybe one of the priests of the Crying God could tell me something... something about those who fall in battle after recommending themselves to a deity.~
@133  = ~Time will tell me what I should do. I just want to leave this place, now. The air is full of death, here.~
@134  = ~Differently from you, I had no reason to hate Irenicus. I was going to help you fight him since you did so much for me: you welcomed me in your party and removed me from a life of poverty, a debt I could only repay by giving you all my strength.~
@135  = ~(Snort!) But now I have a personal reason to hunt that cursed one as well. I... will avenge Yoshimo's death!~
@136  = ~Can you hear me, Irenicus? You have made a new enemy today! Stivan the Hunter will find you, wherever you are! Might the seagull's hate fall on your head!~
@137  = ~I'd like you to make Yoshimo's katana usable by Stivan. Here's the one thousand gold pieces.~
@138  = ~*Ahem* I have another request, if possible.~
@139  = ~I'm listening, brother. What do you need?~
@140  = ~This katana was of the man whose heart I just gave you. I'd... like to use it, but I can't. It is bound to him.~
@141  = ~Why would you like to use it?~
@142  = ~Er...~
@143  = ~Look into your heart and ask yourself why. Listen to your soul, son, and think of your goals.~
@144  = ~... Yoshimo reminds me of one of my dead brothers, all right. I imagine that's how I felt close to him.~
@145  = ~I could save neither of the two, but in either case I can avenge them. That ugly mage will pay for having treated Yoshi like cattle to the slaughter!~
@146  = ~If it's like that, then goals are noble and just. In exchange for a donation of one thousand gold pieces, I'll remove the binding from the weapon.~
@147  = ~Wait a moment, I must ask <CHARNAME> for permission.~
@148  = ~*Ahem* <CHARNAME>, would you please give me one thousand gold pieces to be able to use Yoshimo's katana? Yo know how much I would love to use it, but, if you'd rather not do so, I won't insist too much.~
@149  = ~Pleasepleasepleaseplease!~
@150  = ~One thousand gold pieces for a blade that's only worth thirty? That's a no.~
@151  = ~I'd like to, but I don't have enough coin.~
@152  = ~I imagine that Yoshimo would be happy to know that his blade passed to you. Here's the money you need.~
@153  = ~I'll give you them, but on a condition: *don't* use it to hunt seagulls. Have I made myself clear?~
@154  = ~(Snort!) You're meaner than a flock of raging seagulls!~
@155  = ~Don't worry about it, I'll handle this! I'll empty all pockets in Athkatla, if needed!~
@156  = ~Hey, you! Don't move from here! We'll be back with the sum you asked, okay?~
@157  = ~Yeah! You're great, <CHARNAME>! I always said that you're a true friend! Thanks, thanks!~
@158  = ~Heh. As you wish. We're armed to the teeth, so I won't have trouble finding another weapon with which to gut those birds!~
@159  = ~Either way, thanks, <CHARNAME>. You're great! I always said you're unique!~
@160  = ~Should you change idea, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, you'll find me here. Meanwhile, I'll go back to easing other people's suffering in the name of the Crying God.~
@161  = ~I'll wait for you here. Meanwhile, I'll go back to easing other people's suffering in the name of the Crying God .~
@162  = ~The good soul and kind heart of Ilmater mean that He's not easy to anger, but he doesn't spare his wrath against those who caused great suffering. Might this blade avenge your friend's unjust sorrow.~
@163  = ~Here you go. You'll always be welcome in the house of the Crying God.~
@164  = ~YEAH! <CHARNAME>, I don't know how to thank you! Finally I can use it!!~
@165  = ~Ooohhhhooohhhaaah!~
@166  = ~Heh. This weapon holds incredible potential. I'm sure that the dwarf in the Docks we've already visited might improve on it. Either way, I'm euphoric!~
@167  = ~Heh. This weapon holds incredible potential. If I'm not mistaken, there's a dwarf in the Docks that might improve on it. Either way, I'm euphoric!~
@168  = ~Hey, dwarf, I have a question for you.~
@169  = ~What are you waiting for?~
@170  = ~Do you see this blade? It was of somebody close to me. I'd like to use it, but it was bound to him, and nobody else could ever wield it. Can you do something about it?~
@171  = ~You asked the wrong person. I'm a smith, not a mage; you'll have to ask somebody else if you wish to remove a spell.~
@172  = ~(Snort!) Thanks... of nothing.~
@173  = ~And what about you, do you have some absurd request like your friend's?~
@174  = ~We have work for you, dwarf.~
@175  = ~What is that about?~
@176  = ~Could you improve upon this katana?~
@177  = ~That's not my area of expertize, boy. I'd rather spend my skills as a smith forging artifacts or exotic objects, not mere weapons.~
@178  = ~Listen to me. I promised I'd use this blade to avenge the death of a friend, but I need it improved. The enemy that waits for us is powerful, and it's currently too weak to help me in that.~
@179  = ~Hmm...~
@180  = ~I never tried something like this in the past, but I don't think it will be a problem.~
@181  = ~If you'd like your dead friend's blade to be an instrument of vengeance, I need something of yours. Something that represents you. Something you'd never go without.~
@182  = ~Heh. I think I have what you need. Take this; it should be what you need.~
@183  = ~Uhm? What the hell is this strange whitish goo?~
@184  = ~*Ahem* Mommy always said that secrets cease to be so when revealed, so... don't ask me.~
@185  = ~Very well, very well, give me that. I could improve that katana, if you wish to do so.~
@186  = ~Two things, me friend. It will cost ye 15,000 gp for the work, no less, and without an apprentice, ye'll have to stay here a full day and help me run the forge.~
@187  = ~As ye wish.  Fer such a commission, we can start on it right away.  No sense in wasting time, then... it be best if we just get to it.~
@188  = ~So, do you want to improve upon you friend's weapon or not?~
@189  = ~Ooohhhhh! I never saw a dark elf. Were it not for the color of their skin and hair, they'd be the equal of their hated cousins.~
@190  = ~Miss Nalia is right. Let us burn some seagulls, instead!~
@191  = ~They say that drow are really evil and eat people alive, but this Viconia looks nice to me. Why don't we let her come with us? If worst comes to worst, I will find out what it means to burn alive in a pot.~
@192  = ~(I'd fill her with gold if she did that).~
@193  = ~(Snort!) Mommy always said that women aren't sexual objects!~
@194  = ~But of course. They often act as recipients that can dish out monsters (such as this example right next to me).~
@195  = ~Viconia, I beg you, tell something to him!~
@196  = ~The superiority of the female sex is indubitable and requires no discussion, sakphul. As for you, Red Wizard, I expect to see your words followed by action.~
@197  = ~The superiority of the female sex is indubitable and requires no discussion, sakphul. Although...~
@198  = ~Lil alerl velve zhah lil velkyn uss. The best knife is the unseen one. Maybe you could give reason to be to your useless life, sakphul, and gut that men without anyone seeing.~
@199  = ~Heh. Anything for dear Viconia!~
@200  = ~Nindyn vel'uss kyorl nind ratha thalra elghinn dal lil alust.~
@201  = ~*Ahem* Pardon?~
@202  = ~Those who watch their backs find their deaths from their faces. That rivvil doesn't know that his end is near.~
@203  = ~That's true of you as well, sakphul.~
@204  = ~I've been living in Athkatla since I was born and I never heard of this place.~
@205  = ~Your ingenuity is peerless, waela.~
@206  = ~(Snort!) I have no intention of going away from Viconia!~
@207  = ~Viconia, are you mad? How could you accept to undergo a Geas?~
@208  = ~I'm tired of having trouble with Surface beings, Stivan. He will do as he pleases... his fear amuses me.~
@209  = ~<CHARNAME>! Why would you allow such a thing?!~
@210  = ~I don't have to explain myself to you, Stivan.~
@211  = ~I never really fully trusted Viconia. Now, thanks to Elhan, I can be sure that she won't betray me.~
@212  = ~Io trust Viconia more than anyone else. This Geas isn't but paperwork.~
@213  = ~Do you think I accepted gladly?~
@214  = ~As you can see yourself, those elves were anything but cooperative. Had I refused, I'd have put the whole party in jeopardy.~
@215  = ~You... You don't have to explain yourself to me? Okay! Very well! When you put a rope to my neck I'll force myself not to ask you why!~
@216  = ~She wouldn't betray you! Not after all you did for her! I...~
@217  = ~Then why force her? I...~
@218  = ~Bah! Your mind is more evil than a seagull's!~
@219  = ~*SOB*! I don't want to lose any more friends to these horrible Geas! Yoshi died of exactly such a thing, and I don't want the same thing to happen to Viconia!~
@220  = ~That insufferable darthiir knows perfectly well that my kin's promises are as quick sand. From afar they seem solid and safe, but they prove fleeting and unsafe once you tread on them.~
@221  = ~Viconia DeVir isn't foolish enough to turn on you. Yet. I have nothing to gain out of that.~
@222  = ~What *the hell* are you doing? Keep your hands off me, iblith!~
@223  = ~Heh. I love you, Viccy.~
@224  = ~... Shar be my testimonial, <CHARNAME>: you'll pay for every insolence the little one inflicts on me. Might darkness engulf me if I don't keep my oath up!~



@225  = ~(Sniff sniff) Insomma, <CHARNAME>! Emana puzza di virtuosismo da tutti i pori! Perchè le hai detto di unirsi a noi?~
@226  = ~E' indubbiamente una servitrice del bene. E' per questo che le ho chiesto di venire con noi.~
@227  = ~Sono *io* a decidere la formazione del gruppo. Qualche obiezione?~
@228  = ~Ci aiuterà a superare i pericoli di questo posto, dopodichè sarà libera di andarsene.~
@229  = ~Fantastico. Prossimamente chi arruolerai? Una legione di paladini del Cuore Radioso? Fammelo sapere per tempo, se possibile, così faccio i bagagli e vi lascio brindare in nome del bene e della giustizia!~
@230  = ~Il sottoscritto è più che sufficiente come illustre esponente degli halfling!~
@231  = ~Heh. Meno male!~
@232  = ~Direi di non indugiare oltre e di aprirci la strada in questo luogo di malvagità.~
@233  = ~Ehi, tu! Ce l'hai forse con Mazzy?~
@234  = ~Cos'altro è questo? Straccetto che agita spada?~
@235  = ~Pur essendo più piccoli di te, questo non ti autorizza a trattarci come se fossimo degli insetti!~
@236  = ~Cosa volere te? Ti spacco la faccia, ti spacco!~
@237  = ~Eeekkkk!~
@238  = ~M-Mazzy... Forse è meglio che t-te ne occupi tu...~
@239  = ~Quanto a te, Stivan, ho apprezzato molto il tuo gesto. Non avrei mai immaginato che saresti intervenuto in mia difesa.~
@240  = ~Heh. Lo sai che agisco senza pensare.~
@241  = ~In realtà credo che a poco a poco tu stia diventando coraggioso. Sono sicura che presto potrai affrontare impavido persino un drago!~
@242  = ~Un drago?! Dov'è? *Dov'è*?! DOV'E'?!?!~
@243  = ~Per Arvoreen, Stivan, cosa hai capito...~
@244  = ~EEEKKKKK! Non voglio morireee!!~
@245  = ~(Sigh)~
@246  = ~*Ahem* Tutto qui? Sai, quei cosi mono-occhio ci hanno strapazzato non poco. Per una volta penso che un semplice "Grazie" non basti. Non ho mai preteso ricompense, ma questa volta...~
@247  = ~Ehi! Dove vai? Non ho ancora finito!~
@248  = ~Aspetta, Sassar; prendi questo denaro ed usalo per ricostruirti una vita. Non dimenticare mai quello che hai imparato da questa terribile esperienza.~
@249  = ~Anche volendolo, temo che non ci riuscirei. Io... Ti ringrazio, mia Signora, per la tua generosità.~
@250  = ~Figurati. Che la benedizione di Arvoreen sia con te.~
@251  = ~Sangue e dannazione, Mazzy! Non ho sudato quell'oro per darlo al primo cieco babbeo che incontriamo!~
@252  = ~(Snort!) Sai come li spenderà tutti quei soldi? Di sicuro offrendoli alla divinità che onorava prima!~
@253  = ~Chiederà ammenda per i propri peccati, e probabilmente non esiterà a fare un sacrificio monetario in segno di espiazione. Confido che il suo dio saprà perdonarlo.~
@254  = ~Perdono? Io non perdono i gabbiani per ciò che hanno fatto alla mia famiglia.~
@255  = ~Dovresti. Il rancore inaridisce le persone a lungo andare... E nel tuo caso, vedo che non mi sbaglio.~
@256  = ~Non farmi ridere, Anomen. Non hai mai visto un solo gigante in vita tua, figuriamoci venti.~
@257  = ~Ti consiglio di tenere a freno la tua lingua, piccoletto, prima che ti faccia ingoiare uno di quei volatili per cui tanto impazzisci.~
@258  = ~Forse se ti seppellissimo vivo cambieresti idea. Vogliamo provare?~
@259  = ~Tra poco ti seppellirà la mia mazza, halfling.~
@260  = ~"Gente di basso rango"? Come osi, brutto--~
@261  = ~Stivan, non intrometterti. Lascia che sia io a rispondergli.~
@262  = ~E questa sarebbe la tua risposta? Mazzy, ad un'offesa si risponde con un'offesa!~
@263  = ~Non ce n'è bisogno. A volte, certi insulti definiscono più le persone che li usano.~
@264  = ~... Ho sentito bene? Hai detto... Saerk?~
@265  = ~E' questo il nome di quel mostro!~
@266  = ~Saerk... Farrahd?~
@267  = ~Proprio lui.~
@268  = ~Non è possibile. E' un incubo. Si sta ripetendo lo stesso incubo di allora, tale e quale! Saerk è... E' l'artefice della mia rovina! E' il nobile che mi ha portato via tutto!~
@269  = ~(Snort!) Anch'io ho quattro cosette da dirti!~
@270  = ~Lo dico io cosa dobbiamo fare! E' giunto il momento che quell'infame paghi per ciò che ha fatto! Se non interveniamo *adesso*, un domani altri subiranno ciò che è successo a me e ad Anomen!~
@271  = ~Mi è parso di capire che questo Saerk sia l'uomo che ti ha privato di tutti i tuoi beni, giusto?~
@272  = ~Ho bisogno che tu scenda nei dettagli, Stivan. Chi è questo Saerk? Che cosa ti ha fatto?~
@273  = ~Sì, è lui.~
@274  = ~Saerk è a capo dei Farrahd, una delle più ricche famiglie di Athkatla. Lui... era il socio in affari di mio padre.~
@275  = ~Quando i miei genitori e i miei fratelli vennero uccisi dai gabbiani, gli chiesi subito aiuto. Non avevo la benchè minima idea di come gestire la mia eredità, ma pensavo che lui più di tutti mi avrebbe potuto dare una mano.~
@276  = ~Fu un errore fatale. Quel maledetto riuscì ad impossessarsi degli atti di proprietà della mia famiglia, e fece realizzare dei falsi secondo cui le mie terre appartenevano in realtà ai Farrahd da generazioni.~
@277  = ~Persi tutto. I vigneti, la fattoria. E infine, anche la casa.~
@278  = ~*SOB*! Credevo di essermi lasciato alle spalle il mio burrascoso passato, ma sapere che Saerk continua a rovinare le vite altrui, esattamente come ha fatto con me... Mi fa impazzire dalla rabbia!~
@279  = ~Boo dice che chi è ingiusto ottiene sempre i migliori risultati.~
@280  = ~Boo! Come puoi dire una cosa simile? Tutti gli anni trascorsi a dar calci nelle chiappe al male... Spazzati via da una simile affermazione!~
@281  = ~Ohhhh! Capisco ora! Quell'uomo sta esercitando la sua malvagia influenza su di te! Dobbiamo fermarlo, prima che corrompa del tutto la bontà di questo criceto!~
@282  = ~(Finalmente ho trovato il modo di impiegare quello stupido incantesimo chiamato "Dominare Animali". E pensare che stavo semplicemente cercando un valido passatempo per ignorare gli struggimenti dell'halfling).~
@283  = ~Vorresti portare quest'uomo di fronte alla giustizia? In assenza di prove non credo che andremmo molto lontani. Sarebbe bene rivolgersi alle autorità locali. Una collaborazione potrebbe risultare fruttuosa.~
@284  = ~Come un ragno tesse abilmente la propria tela a spese degli ignari insetti, così quest'uomo ha costruito la sua fortuna sulle disgrazie altrui. E' nostro dovere intervenire affinchè la trama della sua ragnatela non si espanda ulteriormente.~
@285  = ~Pare che il novero dei criminali abbia accolto al suo interno anche i mercanti, come se l’attuale numero non fosse già abbastanza. Forse questa è l’occasione per mostrar loro che ad Athkatla nessuno è libero di agire come meglio crede a spese degli altri.~
@286  = ~Questo Saerk è schifosamente simile ai miei compagni d'un tempo. Per i Nove Inferi, io dico di ucciderlo e di prenderci tutte le sue ricchezze!~
@287  = ~E'... E' molto triste quello che ti è successo, Stivan. Io... Non pensavo che certi uomini potessero essere così cattivi.~
@288  = ~Ah, un colpo di scena! Il mandante dell'assassinio della giovane donna si rivela essere anche l'artefice della miseria del mio piccolo gabbiano. Quale sarà il prossimo sviluppo in questa tragica vicenda?~
@289  = ~Sono basita. Non ho mai visto simili soprusi neanche tra le più altolocate famiglie di Athkatla. E a che scopo? Mira forse ad una scalata sociale?~
@290  = ~Non importa quali siano le sue motivazioni. Dobbiamo fare il possibile per restituire alle vittime di questo mercante ciò che è stato loro sottratto!~
@291  = ~Il rivvil merita di essere ripagato con la stessa moneta, sebbene non si possa negare che abbia un certo talento nel dimostrare la propria superiorità sui deboli.~
@292  = ~Saerk Farrahd è un uomo molto potente, e il suo seguito di guardie è noto per essere poco... amichevole. Se siamo destinati ad inimicarcelo, dovremmo agire con cautela.~
@293  = ~<CHARNAME> ed io abbiamo già incontrato simili sbruffoni in passato, ma questo pallone gonfiato li supera tutti. Propongo una settimana rieducativa nei sotterranei di Candlekeep. Sono sicura che gli farebbe abbassare la cresta, oh sì.~
@294  = ~Dobbiamo intervenire in difesa della giustizia, ma con i mezzi appropriati. Un processo di fronte ad una corte è ciò che quell'individuo merita!~
@295  = ~Per la barba di zio Scratchy! I mercanti sono per definizione dei truffatori, ma il Calimshita non conosce scrupoli! Neanche in occasione della Grande Carestia di Rape del 1348 fui così disonesto. Mi limitai a spacciare per rape delle zucchine adeguatamente incantate con un banale incantesimo d'illusione. Essendo il solo a commerciarle, feci soldi a palate, ma questo attirò l'attenzione dell'esattore delle Tasse e delle Entrate di Amn, un tale di nome Trax. Sai, proprio poco tempo fa stava per mettermi nel sacco, ma sono riuscita a cavarmela grazie al provvidenziale intervento di un gruppo di avventurieri. E' un peccato non averli più rivisti.~
@296  = ~Il racconto del ladro dissolve ogni dubbio sulla malvagità di quest'uomo, ma rimane il fatto che non vi sono prove della sua colpevolezza nè in uno nè nell'altro caso. No, la questione va risolta affidandoci al giudizio di Torm.~
@297  = ~Dovete rimuginare sulla questione ancora per molto? Non è necessario avere una mente geniale come la mia per capire che quel mercante ve la farà ancora una volta a meno che non lo uccidiate!~
@298  = ~I trascorsi dell'halfling non fanno altro che complicare la situazione, pertanto suggerisco di accantonarli, per il momento.~
@299  = ~Mi trovo di fronte ad un bivio, ma non so quale sentiero percorrere. Vendicare la morte di Moira è contro i dettami dell'Ordine; non vendicarla significherebbe invece non onorare la memoria di mia sorella.~
@300  = ~Cosa mi suggerisci di fare, <CHARNAME>?~
@301  = ~Anomen ha ragione. Non c'è motivo di sporcarsi le mani di sangue. Il modo migliore per fargliela pagare è ridurlo in povertà, esattamante come ha fatto con me e con voi.~
@302  = ~Quando il magistrato riconoscerà le sue colpe, perderà ogni cosa... E l'antico e il nuovo sopruso verranno finalmente vendicati!~
@303  = ~La morte di tua sorella non resterà impunita, Anomen. Saerk non l'avrà vinta, non questa volta!~
@304  = ~Così sia. Possa Helm assisterci nella nostra impresa.~
@305  = ~*Ahem* Non pensi che la prigione sarebbe meglio rispetto a questa spedizione punitiva?~
@306  = ~Hai forse intenzione di opporti?~
@307  = ~No, per nulla. Mi stavo semplicemente chiedendo se la morte fosse la pena appropriata per quell'infame. Io avrei preferito vederlo dietro le sbarre per il resto della sua vita, ma se tu e <CHARNAME> pensate che ucciderlo sia la cosa più giusta, non solleverò la benchè minima obiezione.~
@308  = ~Saerk non rimarebbe in prigione per più di un giorno. Non ho dubbi che i suoi tentacoli arrivino persino al Consiglio stesso. No, vendicherò la morte di Moira con la stessa moneta.~
@309  = ~"Bene supremo"? "Uniamoci e cerchiamo"? Io non voglio viaggiare con questo paladino perfettino, <CHARNAME>!~
@310  = ~Non penso di aver fatto alcunché per meritare il tuo astio, ma ascolterò le tue obiezioni senza pregiudizi.~
@311  = ~I membri del Cuore Radioso sono degli ipocriti! Dicono di combattere il male e le ingiustizie, ma in realtà non fanno nulla per contrastare la criminalità e la povertà che dilagano ad Athkatla!~
@312  = ~Anch'io la pensavo così quando avevo visto trenta inverni, ma con l'età ho capito che la violenza non risolve i problemi.~
@313  = ~(Sospira) ... Sono salvo!~
@314  = ~L'hai fatto apposta. Dillo che l'hai fatto apposta!~
@315  = ~Ti consiglio di porre un freno alla tua lingua serpentina, halfling. La tua maldicenza potrebbe costarti cara con persone meno pazienti di me.~
@316  = ~WOW! Questa sì che è una casa, vecchio! Ma le ricchezze che voi paladini acquisite con le vostre crociate non dovrebbero essere distribuite tra i poveri?~
@317  = ~E' ciò che facciamo, ma una parte viene divisa tra i servitori di Torm. Anche noi abbiamo una famiglia a cui provvedere, dopotutto.~
@318  = ~Mi chiedo a quanto ammonti questa parte. Perchè qualcosa mi dice che è decisamente più alta di quella destinata ai *veri* bisognosi?~
@319  = ~NON tollererò altre simili insinuazioni. Mia moglie ed io abbiamo faticato duramente per potercela permettere.~
@320  = ~Già... Dev'essere stata una faticaccia, soprattutto per lei.~
@321  = ~La tua mancanza di rispetto è vergognosa, halfling.~
@322  = ~(Sospira) Coraggio, <CHARNAME>; la mia famiglia ci attende.~
@323  = ~Attento a quel che dici, paladino. Ho tagliato la gola a non so quante guardie che volevano sbattermi in prigione soltanto perchè dormivo per le strade. Continua a minacciare Viconia e aggiungerò anche la tua alla lista.~
@324  = ~Gli amici dei miei nemici sono miei nemici, halfling. Tieni bene a mente il mio avvertimento.~
@325  = ~Brutto energumeno, dovrai passare sul mio cadavere prima di torcerle un solo capello!~
@326  = ~Fatti da parte, piccoletto. Non ho bisogno di essere difesa da nessuno, tantomeno da te. Mi sbarazzerò di questo d'nilok da sola.~
@327  = ~Eppure...~
@328  = ~Stivan, dal tuo zaino proviene un odore tremendo.~
@329  = ~Le mie cacche di gabbiano NON si toccano!~
@330  = ~Tsk. Gli abitanti della Superficie sono il peggior compromesso tra intelligenza e dimensioni del membro.~
@331  = ~Trema, halfling! Tu sarai il primo ad assaggiare il mio nuovo e inarrestabile potere!~
@332  = ~Eeeekk!~
@333  = ~Heh. Sarebbe questo il tuo nuovo e inarrestabile potere, Edwin? O dovrei dire... *Miss* Edwina?~
@334  = ~Taci, microbo! Rimedierò a questo errore e poi ti sistemerò una volta per tutte!~
@335  = ~Yoshimo, posso sapere cosa hai fatto per irritare quest'uomo?~
@336  = ~Un'altra volta, forse.~
@337  = ~Stai dicendo... di averci portato nella tana del leone *apposta*? Yoshimo, questo... Questo è un tradimento!~
@338  = ~Non è detta l'ultima parola, Yoshimo! Troveremo un rimedio, una cura... Si possono cambiare molte cose!~
@339  = ~Temo di no, mio piccolo amico. Nulla può essere cambiato.~
@340  = ~No! No! Devi darmi... *Esigo* che tu mi dia una spiegazione! Io... Non capisco... ~
@341  = ~Ho impiegato una vita intera per capire che non è necessario capire tutto. Il tempo è un grande insegnante, ma sfortunatamente uccide tutti i suoi alunni.~
@342  = ~*Ahem* Non posso fare a meno di chiedermi se il gioco ne valga la candela. Ci stiamo inimicando i più potenti incantatori dell'Amn... Per cosa?~
@343  = ~L'halfling ha ragione. Ti ricordo, <CHARNAME>, che sono stati gli Incappucciati ad imprigionare Irenicus e la tua amica... Vogliamo andare a far loro compagnia?~
@344  = ~Tsk. Ipocrita E ingrato. Un singolare connubio di attributi, Valygar, che meriti come nessun altro.~
@345  = ~Puoi dire quello che vuoi, ma non ucciderò mai un innocente per...~
@346  = ~Per cosa? Per una causa meritevole come quella di <CHARNAME>? Puah! Sputo su di te e sulla tua moralità da accattoni!~
@347  = ~Pondera bene la tua prossima scelta, <CHARNAME>. La lingua velenosa di quest'halfling è già di per sè un motivo più che valido per andarmene.~
@348  = ~(Sniff sniff) Ranger, sei sicuro di non aver confuso l'odore di questo posto con quello delle tue ascelle?~
@349  = ~(Sigh) <CHARNAME>, a cosa pensavi quando gli hai chiesto di seguirti?~
@350  = ~Quando mendicavo per le strade, nessuno è mai stato così generoso con me.~
@351  = ~Non c'è stato un solo nobile che ti abbia dato qualche moneta d'oro? Gli Argrim, ad esempio?~
@352  = ~No.~
@353  = ~E gli Jysstev?~
@354  = ~Nemmeno.~
@355  = ~E' una vergogna! Un'indecenza! Con appena la metà delle ricchezze che possiedono potrebbero sfamare tutti gli abitanti di Athkatla, eppure non muovono un dito!~
@356  = ~Miss Nalia, è giusto che sia così. Nè io nè i miei familiari ci siamo mai preoccupati di aiutare i mendicanti a suo tempo. Immagino che sia una sorta di... contrappasso.~
@357  = ~*Ahem* Non che la cosa mi abbia entusiasmato. Ne avrei fatto volentieri a meno.~
@358  = ~Jaheira ha ragione. Neanch'io ne ero a conoscenza.~
@359  = ~E perchè mai avresti dovuto? I servitori dell'equilibrio non cantano ai quattro venti dove hanno stabilito le loro basi.~
@360  = ~Ma i Ladri Tenebrosi sì. Dovresti sapere che non scorre buon sangue tra le ombre dell'Amn e gli Arpisti... Se questa tenuta fosse stata adibita a tale scopo fin da quando ero piccolo, l'intera città ormai lo saprebbe.~
@361  = ~(Tossisce) Che... Che schifo è mai questo? Nemmeno i vicoli in cui dormivo erano così ripugnanti! Do... (Tossisce) Dobbiamo proseguire per forza? Io... Spero di no...~
@362  = ~*Ahem* Questa donna mi mette a disagio, <CHARNAME>. Ho la pelle d'oca...~
@363  = ~Il sol pensiero di lavorare per questa donna mi fa drizzare i peli dei piedi, ma l'importante è riuscire nella tua missione, giusto?~
@364  = ~*Ahem* Dobbiamo proprio? La gente, qui ai Moli, dice che chi entra in quella casa non ne esce più vivo...~
@365  = ~E dov'è il problema, mio gabbiano? Se ci attende la morte, avremo il piacere di fare un viaggio senza valigie.~
@366  = ~Da quando fanno entrare simili lordure in un quartiere benestante come questo?~
@367  = ~Heh. La sola lordura che vedo, signore, è quella che avete sotto i vostri piedi.~
@368  = ~MIA MAMMA DICE CHE GLI HALFLING SONO TUTTI DEI PUZZONI!~
@369  = ~Non è vero! Mi lavo sempre almeno una volta ogni sei mesi!~
@370  = ~Allontanati, accattone! La tua sola vicinanza offusca lo splendore delle mie perle!~
@371  = ~Heh. Brillano bene, per essere finte.~
@372  = ~E' senz'altro opera degli adoratori di alberi! Ho sempre sospettato che fossero loro i responsabili di ciò che è successo alla mia famiglia, e questi episodi lasciano pochi dubbi a proposito! Dobbiamo indagare, <CHARNAME>!~
@373  = ~Conosco Trademeet - ci sono stato diverse volte con la mia famiglia. Se siamo fortunati, potremmo incontrare qualche mercante con cui eravamo soliti commerciare. Sono sicuro che farebbero il possibile per aiutarci a trovare quei druidi puzzoni!~
@374  = ~WOW! Questa cripta è perfetta! C'è spazio anche per gli altri membri del gruppo, nel caso in cui vogliano farci un pisolino!~
@375  = ~Nessuno profanerà il luogo del mio riposo. Taglierò le vostre teste una ad una e le infilerò su una picca, cosicchè possano essere da monito agli intrusi!~
@376  = ~Eeeekkk!~
@377  = ~Yeah! Non ne potevo più di quei cosi tentacolosi!~
@378  = ~Stivan, l'halfling nativo di Athkatla con la fissazione per i gabbiani. Sempre pronto a ribattere, spesso sornione e a tratti infantile, ti ha seguito sin dal vostro primo incontro senza esitazione, benchè non abbia alcun trascorso con colui che ti ha rubato l'anima.~
@379  = ~Torna ad Athkatla, Stivan. Non hai motivo di scontrarti con Irenicus.~
@380  = ~Ti sono grato per il tuo aiuto, Stivan, ma adesso è meglio che tu te ne vada. Non hai motivo di rischiare la tua vita.~
@381  = ~Stivan, la battaglia che ci attende è molto pericolosa. Ho bisogno che tu dia il meglio di te.~
@382  = ~*Ahem* Non ti seguirò nella battaglia suicida che ti attende, <CHARNAME>. Non correrò il rischio di morire con l'urna dei miei familiari tra le mani.~
@383  = ~E' stato bello viaggiare con te. Avrei continuato a seguirti volentieri, ma i miei genitori e i miei fratelli hanno la priorità. Devono riposare in pace.~
@384  = ~Io torno ad Athkatla. In bocca al lupo!~
@385  = ~Non dire sciocchezze, <CHARNAME>. Dopo tutto quello che hai fatto per me, combattere al tuo fianco è il minimo che possa fare per sdebitarmi.~
@386  = ~Ti sbagli, <CHARNAME>. Quel bruttone è responsabile della morte di Yoshimo, ed io ho giurato che l'avrei vendicata.~
@387  = ~Sarò al tuo fianco sino all'ultimo respiro. Insieme pianteremo la lama del nostro defunto amico nel cuore di quel mostro!~
@388  = ~Puoi contare su di me. Sai quanta cacca di gabbiano ho messo da parte per questo scontro? TONNELLATE.~
@389  = ~Mi raccomando: dritta in fronte.~
@390  = ~Ottimo. Gliela faremo mangiare sino all'ultimo boccone.~
@391  = ~Lascia che sia il ferro a parlare.~
@392  = ~Yeah!~
@393  = ~Heh. Gli pianterò un pugnale sulla schiena, se è questo che vuoi, ma prima mi accerterò che sia adeguatamente ricoperto di escrementi!~
@394  = ~(Gasp!) Il... Il mio corpo! E' ancora integro, eppure... Ho sentito una forza che tirava e tirava, e ho pensato che mi avrebbe fatto a pezzi!~
@395  = ~*Ahem* Non capisco. Siamo vivi... O morti?~
@396  = ~E' ora di finirla una volta per tutte, bruttone. Possano i gabbiani cibarsi dei tuoi resti!~
@397  = ~E' ora di finirla una volta per tutte, bruttone. I tuoi resti marciranno in questo posto per l'eternità!~
@398  = ~Haer’Dalis sarebbe il nome di quell’attore magro magro coi capelli lunghi lunghi?~
@399  = ~Sì, piccolino. Sei forse un amico del nostro segugio?~
@400  = ~Oh, no. L’ho semplicemente visto recitare qualche volta. Avete idea del perchè l'abbiano rapito?~
@401  = ~Ma questo, a meno che non mi sbagli, è un attore della compagnia teatrale in scena ai Cinque Boccali. Cosa ci fa qui? Soprattutto, perché ha quell’espressione inebetita?~
@402  = ~Questo è l’attore che Miss Raelis ci ha chiesto di trovare, lo riconosco. Però è strano... L’ultima volta che l’ho visto non aveva questa espressione inebetita. Che quel bruttone del mago gli abbia fatto qualcosa?~
@403  = ~Sarebbe bello se tu viaggiassi con noi, Haer’Dalis. Sai che ho assistito ad alcune delle tue ultime rappresentazioni?~
@404  = ~Davvero? E dimmi, qual è quella che ti ha maggiormente colpito?~
@405  = ~“Via Col Cambion” mi ha commosso. La sua drammaticità non ha paragoni. E’ un peccato che Biff sia sbucato all’improvviso dalla botola del palco - il pubblico ha riso per tutto il resto dell’opera!~
@406  = ~Tsk. Solo gli abitanti del Primo Piano sono capaci di versare lacrime per un gorgheggio sentimentale e nel medesimo istante di ridere sgangheratamente per un piccolo contrattempo.~
@407  = ~*Ahem* Visto che viaggeremo insieme, perché non mi insegni ad essere un buon bardo? Io ho provato, ma spesso la memoria mi abbandona a metà del racconto o della poesia...~
@408  = ~Temo proprio di no, ragazzino. L’Arte è un talento innato, un dono di cui disponiamo sin dal nostro primo gemito. Non è qualcosa che si possa insegnare.~
@409  = ~Ebbene, <CHARNAME>, attendo l'ardita sentenza. Esploreremo fianco a fianco questa landa sconosciuta?~
@410  = ~(Sniff sniff) A meno che il mio olfatto non mi stia tradendo, quell’orco puzza di pennuto. So che sembra assurdo, ma il mio naso non si sbaglia mai!~
@411  = ~Cerca di non camminare troppo vicino a me. Benchè tu non abbia più le tue ali, rimani pur sempre un’ex-pennuta, e il tuo odore...~
@412  = ~Ehi! Cosa stai facendo?!~
@413  = ~Mi-mi prendo cura di questo povero gabbiano. Guarda com’è ridotto! Ha bisogno di cure!~
@414  = ~(Urla) Come osi liberare quello schifido uccello dalla giusta prigionia che merita? Ridammelo *subito*!~
@415  = ~Io... Farò il possibile perchè si riprenda e torni a volare nel cielo azzurro con i suoi simili. Prima però dobbiamo salvare Quayle!~
@416  = ~Non puoi fare una cosa simile, <CHARNAME>! Se la liberatrice di pennuti verrà con noi, i gabbiani sfuggiranno alle mie sevizie e allo spennamento che meritano!~
@417  = ~Mi stavo chiedendo, nano... Perchè in cambio del nostro aiuto non realizzi qualche gingillo magico per noi?~
@418  = ~Io non sono un maniaco del martello e dell’incudine, bamboccio. Le sole cose che brandisco sono ascia e scudo, e presto li userò per aprirmi la strada tra le carcasse ammuffite di quella cripta!~
@419  = ~Anch’io commerciavo merce illegale, sai? Piume di gabbiano, per la precisione. Non era un’attività particolarmente redditizia, ma di tanto in tanto riuscivo a guadagnare una moneta d’oro per mangiare almeno una pagnotta.~
@420  = ~Piume di gabbiano? Accidenti, mio cugino Eduardo potrebbe averne bisogno per perfezionare quel congegno che sostiene sia in grado di volare. Se soltanto sapessi che fine abbia fatto. Non vorrei che alla fine abbia spiccato davvero il volo.~
@421  = ~Sbaglio o queste sono le terre dei De’Arnise? La figlia dell’attuale Lord è nota in tutta Athkatla per la sua generosità.~
@422  = ~A ben guardarvi, le assomigliate un pochino.~
@423  = ~Che sciocco che sono! Siete *voi* la mitica Miss Nalia! Come ho fatto a non capirlo subito?~
@424  = ~Non ho nulla di mitico, davvero. Cerco soltanto di usare i mezzi di cui dispongo per aiutare i meno fortunati.~
@425  = ~Ma questa donna... Questa donna è Miss Nalia De'Arnise! E' nota in tutta Athkatla per la sua generosità! Perchè non le hai detto di unirsi a noi, <CHARNAME>? Hai idea del prestigio sociale che avremmo acquisito in sua compagnia?~
@426  = ~Nessuno di noi viaggia con <CHARNAME> per simili banalità, Stivan. Alcuni non hanno avuto nemmeno la possibilità di scegliere.~
@427  = ~Ah no?~
@428  = ~(Snort!) Perchè guardi nella mia direzione?~
@429  = ~Nalia, non prendere troppa confidenza con i popolani, per favore. Forse tu non te ne rendi conto, ma la semplice vicinanza a quel barbone rende irriconoscibile la tua nobile discendenza.~
@430  = ~Popolano io?! Un tempo appartenevo ad una famiglia di mercanti rispettati in tutta Athkatla!~
@431  = ~Quel tempo è ormai passato, a quanto vedo. Questo cicisbeo viene dai Bassifondi o da qualche altro quartiere degradato a cui hai fatto visita?~
@432  = ~Ehi, tu! Perché continui ad importunare Miss Nalia?~
@433  = ~Sei ancora in compagnia di quel popolano?~
@434  = ~Ti ho già detto che Stivan non è un popolano. E anche se lo fosse, non ci sarebbe nulla di cui vergognarsi.~
@435  = ~Per quanto tu possa vestire un mendicante con gli abiti di un nobile, dai suoi modi si capirà sempre che non ha il sangue blu. Ma non ho tempo per simili disquisizioni. Allontanati da questa manica di orchetti, ora!~
@436  = ~Heh. Non preoccupatevi, Miss Nalia; quell'uomo sta chiaramente bluffando.~
@437  = ~(Snort!) E' ora di finirla con questa messinscena! Osa avvicinarti a Miss Nalia e dovrai vedertela con me!~
@438  = ~Un solo passo falso, *popolano*, e ti ritroverai alla forca senza neanche accorgertene.~
@439  = ~Non possiamo permettere che Miss Nalia cada nelle mani di quel manigoldo! Dobbiamo liberarla! O invocare l'ira dei gabbiani su quell'infame! <CHARNAME>, dobbiamo fare qualcosa!~
@440  = ~Heh. Se vuoi che mi occupi io di questo recupero, <CHARNAME>, non devi far altro che chiedere.~
@441  = ~Grazie, ma ci penso io.~
@442  = ~Grazie, mi hai tolto la preoccupazione di doverlo fare io stesso.~
@443  = ~Tornerai a chiedermelo in ginocchio, lo so!~
@444  = ~Yeah! Andiamo là, allora!~
@445  = ~PIUME DI GABBIANO! Andate e colpite!~
@446  = ~Ma cosa diavolo...?!~
@447  = ~Yeah! L’ho presa! Ecco qui la collana che cercavi, <CHARNAME>!~
@448  = ~(Sigh) Hai idea di come reagirebbe Edwin se gli portassi un gioiello al posto delle carte di cui aveva bisogno?~
@449  = ~Stivan, forse non mi sono spiegato bene. Mi servono i *documenti* che quell’uomo ha con sé, non articoli di bigiotteria!~
@450  = ~Fenomenale. Davvero. Peccato che l’oggetto del furto fosse un plico di fogli, non un pendente per il collo.~
@451  = ~Whoops.~
@452  = ~Non disperare, <CHARNAME>! Rimedio subito!~
@453  = ~Ehi, tu!~
@454  = ~Maledizione a te, halfling! Quelle piume mi hanno quasi accecato! Si può sapere cosa --~
@455  = ~CACCA DI GABBIANO! Và e colpisci!~
@456  = ~Ahhh! Non vedo più nulla! Aiuto! Aiuto!!~
@457  = ~Presi!~
@458  = ~Dove sei, maledetto? Dove sei?! Se ti prendo...!!!~
@459  = ~Diamocela a gambe, <CHARNAME>!~
@460  = ~Anomen non è da solo! Ci sono anch'io, Saerk!~
@461  = ~Il marmocchio dei Fristbrowfine? Cosa ci fai qui?~
@462  = ~Sono venuto a vendicarmi! E' giunta l'ora che tu paghi per tutti i tuoi soprusi!~
@463  = ~Cor è così disperato da mandarmi contro il figlio e questo poveraccio? Ha! Non fatemi ridere!~
@464  = ~Non sei cambiato per nulla, mostro! Sei sempre lo stesso essere spregevole che gode nell'annichilire gli altri, proprio come hai fatto con me!~
@465  = ~Ancora con quella storia? Le terre di tuo padre erano troppo redditizie per lasciarle in mano ad un incompetente come te!~
@466  = ~(Urla) Idiota! Io stesso ti avevo detto di non esserne in grado! E' per questo che mi ero rivolto a te!~
@467  = ~Non importa. Non puoi *nulla* contro di me. E neanche tu, Anomen.~
@468  = ~Presto l'avvenire ti riserverà un altro lungo decennio di solitudine, giovanotto, ma non disperare: quando la Regina Bianca cadrà, vittima del complotto ordito dalla Regina Nera per mano di un assassino dal mantello oscuro, risponderai alla chiamata del Destino, e aiuterai i Reami nella ricerca della salvezza.~
@469  = ~Oh, no! Non voglio restare di nuovo solo e senza amici! Sei sicura di aver visto bene tra i peli della mia mano?~
@470  = ~Dobbiamo andare a fondo in questa vicenda. Sono pronto a scommettere che i druidi c'entrano qualcosa con lo sterminio dei miei familiari.~
@471  = ~Accolgo con dispiacere questa triste notizia. E' successo di recente?~
@472  = ~No, risale ad otto anni fa, ma di sicuro sono stati loro a manovrare i gabbiani che hanno ucciso i miei genitori e i miei fratelli!~
@473  = ~Qui a Trademeet gli attacchi da parte degli animali sono iniziati nelle ultime settimane, pertanto dubito che siano connessi ad un episodio così remoto.~
@474  = ~Accidenti, ero certo che... Well, non importa. *Adesso* sono di sicuro loro i responsabili di tutto questo caos.~
@475  = ~Heh. Pare che a casa Firecam tiri una brutta aria.~
@476  = ~(Gasp!) Quell'uomo si è rivelato più pericoloso di quanto pensassi! C'è... C'è forse il rischio che Miss Nalia venga venduta come concubina?~
@477  = ~Roenal terrà la ragazza ben stretta a sé. In fin dei conti, gli serve per ottenere le terre da lui ambite. Non escludo però che possa anche decidere di sbarazzarsene una volta conseguito il suo scopo.~
@478  = ~Cosa?! Preferirei essere divorato da uno stormo di gabbiani piuttosto che abbandonare Miss Nalia ad un simile destino! Possibile che quell'infame sia così intoccabile come dice di essere?~
@479  = ~No, non lo è. Vi darò alcune indicazioni di cui potrete servirvi per riscattare la vostra amica. Ovviamente, io non vi ho detto niente, e questo incontro non è mai avvenuto.~
@480  = ~Grazie a quest'uomo abbiamo una pista da seguire adesso. Se hai bisogno del mio aiuto, <CHARNAME>, sappi che farò qualsiasi cosa per salvare Miss Nalia!~
@481  = ~No! Non possiamo permettere che quella bruttona porti via con sè Viconia! <CHARNAME>, inseguiamola!~
@482  = ~No! Non possiamo permettere che quella bruttona porti via con sè Jaheira! <CHARNAME>, inseguiamola!~
@483  = ~No! Non possiamo permettere che quella bruttona porti via con sè Anomen! <CHARNAME>, inseguiamola!~
@484  = ~No! Non possiamo permettere che quella bruttona porti via con sè Aerie - soltanto io ho il diritto di maltrattarla! <CHARNAME>, inseguiamola!~
@485  = ~No! Non possiamo permettere che quella bruttona porti via con sè Aerie - se non posso maltrattarla io, nessuno può! <CHARNAME>, inseguiamola!~
@486  = ~L...l'avevo detto! Un drago! Si salvi chi può!~
@487  = ~Non agitarti. Non hai motivo di temermi.~
@488  = ~Non agitarti. Sebbene le vostre azioni siano state turpi e vergognose, non subirete la mia ira. Le attuali circostanze, tuttavia, richiedono una collaborazione.~
@489  = ~Non riesco a crederci, <CHARNAME>. Abbiamo le sembianze dei drow!~
@490  = ~Mah. Preferisco di gran lunga il mio vero corpo. E' molto più forte e muscoloso di questo.~
@491  = ~Dove sono finiti i peli dei miei piedi?~
@492  = ~Le mie guance paffute... Sono sparite!~
@493  = ~Non mi sento per nulla a mio agio con queste sembianze.~
@494  = ~Una simile magia è a dir poco portentosa. Pochissimi incantatori riuscirebbero ad emularla.~
@495  = ~Hai visto come son figo, eh?~
@496  = ~Cosa ne pensi, Stivan? Mi trovi più bella così o con le sembianze di un <PRO_RACE>?~
@497  = ~Well, adesso potremo vantarci di aver fatto un'esperienza decisamente unica.~
@498  = ~Non sei il solo a sentirsi disorientato. Anch'io avrò bisogno di un pò di tempo per abituarmi a questo aspetto.~
@499  = ~In effetti sei irriconoscibile, <CHARNAME>.~
@500  = ~Heh. Anch'io non riesco a credere di avere dei piedi lisci.~
@501  = ~E' vero, hai un volto più scavato rispetto a prima. Sei praticamente irriconoscibile!~
@502  = ~Well, a parte il colore della pelle, sei praticamente identico a prima.~
@503  = ~*Ahem* Avevo capito fin da subito che non aveva intenzioni ostili.~
@504  = ~Heh. A quanto pare, sei soddisfatto del tuo nuovo aspetto.~
@505  = ~(Arrossisce) Well, i tuoi attributi... Sono rimasti inalterati...~
@506  = ~Heh. Samuel rimarrà sbalordito quando glielo racconterò!~
@507  = ~Io... Ho un pò di vertigini. Non sono abituato a simili altezze. E' meglio procedere piano piano, senza fretta. Non voglio sbucciarmi le ginocchia a furia di cadere.~
@508  = ~Po... Posso farvi una ri-richiesta, illustrissima e v-veneranda...~
@509  = ~Non c'è tempo per inutili adulazioni. Parla, ma sii rapido.~
@510  = ~Well, ecco... Io... Mi stavo chiedendo s-se... Se fosse possibile m-mantenere questo... q-questo aspetto...~
@511  = ~Vorresti mantenere le sembianze di un elfo dal cuore nero? Ho capito bene?~
@512  = ~S-sì...~
@513  = ~E' fuori discussione. Dissolverò l'illusione che io stessa ho creato e vi condurrò verso l'uscita. Questi erano i patti, e non intendo sentire altre assurde richieste.~
@514  = ~Ma...~
@515  = ~Silenzio! Non ammetterò repliche!~
@516  = ~Sbaglio o quell'halfling è praticamente identico a me?~
@517  = ~Le uniche copie buone sono quelle che ci fanno vedere il ridicolo nei cattivi originali.~
@518  = ~Heh. Ho l'impressione che questo fosse un insulto, Haer'Dalis.~
@519  = ~Non oserei mai, mio gabbiano.~
@520  = ~(Gasp!) Quest'uomo è un infedele! Ha tradito la propria moglie!~
@521  = ~Chi ha detto che l'adulterio è sinonimo di infedeltà? A volte consente di mantenersi fedele all'amante per tutta la vita.~
@522  = ~Miss Nalia, potrei giurare di aver visto quella nobildonna rubare alla Passeggiata. Com'è possibile una cosa simile?~
@523  = ~Si suppone sempre che le persone facoltose non abbiano bisogno di rubare, Stivan, ma non è facile cambiare le proprie abitudini.~
@524  = ~Ti consiglio di concludere i tuoi affari con questo Linvail il più presto possibile, <CHARNAME>. I Signori delle Ombre cambiano di continuo ad Athkatla, e non vorrei che qualcuno prendesse il suo posto prima che tu abbia raggiunto il tuo obiettivo.~
@525  = ~Una volta sono passato per queste colline, <CHARNAME>, ma non sono altro che una distesa brulla e deserta, se ricordo bene. Mi chiedo cosa ci facciano dei predatori in una zona simile.~
@526  = ~(Sniff) Sei proprio una brava persona, <CHARNAME>. Hai dato un grande aiuto a queste persone, esattamente come hai fatto con me il giorno in cui mi hai accolto nella tua compagnia.~
@527  = ~Miss Nalia, avete visto che bel gesto ha fatto?~
@528  = ~Sì, Stivan. Un ottimo esempio da cui trarre ispirazione, sebbene dubiti che troverebbe seguito tra le famiglie della vecchia guardia.~
@529  = ~Se non fossi già il vostro umile sguattero, l'avrei servito e riverito a dovere, ma la vostra nobiltà ha la precedenza.~
@530  = ~Hmmf. Penso che avrebbe anche potuto separarsi da qualche moneta d'oro e dare un aiuto più concreto a quei poveri sventurati.~
@531  = ~Non sminuite il suo gesto.~
@532  = ~Per correggere le iniquità e sradicare la povertà, non basta tendere la mano ai bisognosi, Stivan. Occorre anche aiutarli a camminare fino a quando non saranno capaci di reggersi sulle proprie gambe.~
@533  = ~Well, ecco... Certo, Miss Nalia. Avete sempre ragione voi.~
@534  = ~(Bisbigliando) Non è vero, <CHARNAME>, io sono con te. Ogni tanto la nostra amica sragiona, ma non posso contraddirla davanti a tutti. La farei sfigurare.~
@535  = ~Er... Io credevo che quella di Umar fosse solo una favola raccontata dalle madri halfling per spaventare i loro piccoli quando facevano i monelli o cose simili.~
@536  = ~Ovviamente con me non ce n'è mai stato bisogno.~
@537  = ~Gli Stregoni Incappucciati sono incredibilmente bravi a catturare le persone. Peccato che spesso siano quelle sbagliate.~
@538  = ~Heh. Mia mamma diceva sempre che i suoi ceffoni erano più che sufficienti.~
@539  = ~Non contare sul loro aiuto, perchè non arriverà. Meglio che impari a difenderti da solo, proprio come ho fatto io.~
@540  = ~(Arrossisce) Non... Non dirlo neanche per scherzo!~
@541  = ~Wow, esistono drow simpatici!~
@542  = ~La sua simpatia gli sarà di ben poca utilità quando quella femmina gli strapperà la pelle di dosso per la sua insolenza.~
@543  = ~Yeah! Diglielo in faccia!~
@544  = ~Non ti immischiare in faccende che non ti riguardano.~
@545  = ~Che sia questa la soluzione migliore? Io... Dopo aver ascoltato il racconto dell'halfling, faccio fatica ad accettare l'idea che quell'uomo sia innocente.~
@546  = ~Tu stesso hai detto che i trascorsi di Stivan non devono influenzare il tuo giudizio. In questo momento non ci stiamo chiedendo se Saerk sia responsabile di un'appropriazione indebita; ci stiamo chiedendo se sia il mandante dell'assassinio di tua sorella, e a tal proposito non abbiamo nessuna prova della sua colpevolezza.~
@547  = ~Uhm... Non hai tutti torti. Attribuire la responsabilità ad un brigante qualunque non avrebbe senso. Sarebbe inverosimile. L'accesa rivalità con tuo padre è invece un movente più che valido, soprattutto se consideriamo il non trascurabile precedente con Stivan. E sia. Vendicheremo la morte di Moira.~
@548  = ~A questo punto la decisione è tua, Anomen. Non me la sento di pronunciarmi su una questione così delicata.~
@549  = ~Ti capisco, <CHARNAME>. Non posso riporre sulle tue spalle il peso di una simile scelta. Spetta a me e a me solo.~
@550  = ~E' deciso. Non lascerò che la morte di mia sorella rimanga impunita. Vieni, <CHARNAME>... Andiamo da Saerk e facciamo giustizia!~
@551  = ~Non è giusto. Se la gente piccola fosse trattata con più rispetto e meno sufficienza, questo gnomo non avrebbe mai fatto una cosa simile.~
@552  = ~Tsk. Le guardie non fanno nulla se non prendersela con gli innocenti. Non avete idea di quante volte mi abbiano rincorso per la città senza motivo.~
@553  = ~Ho il vago ricordo di averti visto inseguito da un gruppo di guardie per aver lanciato loro in faccia del guano. Mi sbaglio?~
@554  = ~(Arrossisce) Well, ecco... Forse quella volta sono stato io ad istigarle...~
@555  = ~Quella volta, eh?~
@556  = ~Se quella nave è sempre stata la base degli schiavisti sin dal loro arrivo in città, allora... Allora sono qui da prima che nascessi!~
@557  = ~Anche papà ebbe il tuo stesso problema. Non ricordo con chi parlò, ma alla fine riuscì a spuntarla.~
@558  = ~Mia mamma diceva sempre di non fidarsi degli Stregoni Rossi. Pare che siano noti in tutti i Reami per il loro... *Ahem*... opportunismo.~
@559  = ~Dove hai trovato questo scarto umano, <CHARNAME>? In una pila di rifiuti?~
@560  = ~Non è vero! Non stavo rovistando nella spazzatura quando <PRO_HIMHER> ed io ci siamo incontrati!~
@561  = ~(L'halfling si è appena aggiudicato il primo posto nella lista dei seccatori da eliminare).~
@562  = ~Bah! Meglio vivere da orfani che con un padre paladino!~
@563  = ~A chi la do a bere... Sopporterei di sapere entrambi i genitori e tutti i miei fratelli nell'Ordine pur di riaverli... *SOB*!~
@564  = ~Ehi! Voglio combattere nella tua fossa!~
@565  = ~Non ho tempo da perdere con le tue schiocchezze, piccoletto.~
@566  = ~Gua-~
@567  = ~Voi altri, che volete adesso?~
@568  = ~Voglio combattere nella tua fossa!~
@569  = ~Questa è bella. Con chi vorresti combattere, nanerottolo? Con delle mosche? Delle pulci?~
@570  = ~No, con dei gabbiani.~
@571  = ~Gabbiani? Non farmi perdere tempo.~
@572  = ~Farti perdere tempo? Non sai che io sono Stivan il Cacciatore?~
@573  = ~Stivan il Cacciatore? Due anni fa ti pagai una piuma di gabbiano e non me l'hai mai consegnata! Adesso io ti prendo e-~
@574  = ~Hai il coraggio di tornare qui, piccoletto?~
@575  = ~Sì. Ho catturato DIECI gabbiani prima di entrare, e combatterò con loro nella tua arena. I proventi saranno sufficienti a colmare il mio debito.~
@576  = ~Hmpf. Io pensavo di ucciderti, ma il tuo modo sembra più divertente. Puoi combattere anche adesso.~
@577  = ~Divertiti, Stivan.~
@578  = ~Alcuni dei miei compagni si rifiutano di vedere combattere gli animali. Aspetta cinque minuti che li allontano.~
@579  = ~Mi rifiuto di avere a che fare con un simile spettacolo.~
@580  = ~Allora vuoi fare l'eroe? L'halfling mi deve cento monete d'oro. Tirale fuori.~
@581  = ~E sia - prendi i soldi.~
@582  = ~Scordatelo.~
@583  = ~Hai i soldi del piccoletto?~
@584  = ~Credo che Stivan sia pronto a combattere.~
@585  = ~Sì. Eccoti le cento monete.~
@586  = ~Bene. E adesso sparite!~
@587  = ~Sparisci dalla mia vista. Ti consiglio di avere i soldi pronti la prossima volta che mi vedi.~
@588  = ~Hmpf. Complimenti, hai saldato il debito.~
@589  = ~Avete bisogno di qualcos'altro, o volete solo farmi perdere del tempo?~
@590  = ~Wow! Vorrei che anche le mie piume fossero così affilate!~
@591  = ~L'hai comprata dal Pollice, vero? Quell’oste ha il brutto vizio di allungare il vino con l'acqua.~
@592  = ~Io dico di unirci a loro. Ai Paladini Decaduti, intendo. Possiamo arricchirci in modo illegale e insozzare l'onore del Cuore Radioso... Nessun lato negativo per questa opzione, dico io!~
@593  = ~Mi auguro che il capo del tuo gruppo sia più sensato di te, halfling.~
@594  = ~Yippie! Non dobbiamo ubbidire ai paladini!~
@595  = ~Conosco qualcuno che conosce qualcuno... Potremmo rimediare un bel gruzzoletto vendendo quella coppa!~
@596  = ~Se osi parlare ancora di cose simili ti rimuoverò la lingua, Stivan!~
@597  = ~Chi ti ha detto il mio nome?~
@598  = ~La stessa persona che mi avviserebbe se tu tentassi di mettere atto al tuo piano.~
@599  = ~Abbiamo ubbidito a dei paladini e ucciso dei simpatici contrabbandieri per un paio di guanti? Bah, che perdita di tempo e opportunità per arricchirci.~
@600  = ~Le tue azioni hanno aiutato il Bene, per cui ignorerò i tuoi insulti, per ora. Ti consiglio di non presentarti più al mio cospetto, Stivan.~
@601  = ~(Snort!) Simili tragedie non accadrebbero se le guardie facessero il loro dovere!~
@602  = ~Non dubito che la milizia locale sia inadempiente, Stivan, ma è bene essere critici portando nuove idee anzichè semplici accuse.~
@603  = ~Perchè tanta preoccupazione per dei semplici ragni?~
@604  = ~Per i servitori della Natura, preservare la vita delle creature della Madre è il comandamento più importante nella sua forma più reverenziale.~
@605  = ~Heh. Non ho capito nulla, tranne il fatto che in qualche modo vuoi essere d’aiuto a quelle bestioline.~
@606  = ~Recuperare il pupazzo del bambino non basta - l'assassino deve essere fermato, prima che mieta altre vittime!~
@607  = ~Porremo fine a questa minaccia insieme, Stivan. Non possiamo permettere che la nostra gente venga colpita da simili tragedie!~
@608  = ~Prima l'accattone, ora il trapassato. Hai qualche perversa inclinazione per i bambocci halfling, <CHARNAME>?~
@609  = ~Vorrei vedere come ti sentiresti se avessero rubato il tuo, di orsacchiotto!~
@610  = ~... Allontanatemi il poppante, per le chiappe di Abbathor, prima che lo spedisca nell'Abisso dai suoi consanguinei!~
@611  = ~Puoi starne certo, mostro! Muori!~
@612  = ~No! Non possiamo lasciare invendicata la morte del bambino halfling, <CHARNAME>! Non lo permetterò!~
@613  = ~Sono con te, Stivan! In nome di Arvoreen, giustizia sarà fatta!~
@614  = ~Heh. Già mi vedo nei panni della spia, mentre cerco indizi o elimino i testimoni scomodi. Stivan il Cacciatore sta per farsi un nome tra le Ombre dell'Amn!~
@615  = ~Nel caso ti fosse sfuggito, Stivan, non stiamo andando a giocare a guardie e ladri.~
@616  = ~Heh. Ti voglio nella mia squadra, Yoshi.~
@617  = ~Soprattutto, tieni d'occhio il piccoletto. Non vorrei che scoprissero la nostra vera identità ancor prima di esserci avvicinati a Mae’Var.~
@618  = ~(Gasp!) Siamo stat -- Umpppphh!~
@619  = ~Perdoni l'interruzione, signore. Qual è il nome del nostro obiettivo?~
@620  = ~Heh. Mi sembra un ottimo piano per sbarazzarsi degli Incappucciati e del qui presente Edwin.~
@621  = ~(Sospettavo che l'halfling tramasse contro la mia persona, ma questo piano è diabolico. Non lascerò che mi spediscano a casa da mamma. Non dopo che mi ha schiaffeggiato per averle detto di starsene un pò zitta!)~
@622  = ~*Mia* mamma diceva sempre che la classe dei nobili collasserebbe su se stessa se non vi fossero quelle medie e inferiori. Come la mettiamo adesso, eh?~
@623  = ~(Sospira) Mi piacerebbe tanto saper decantare poesie e filastrocche come questo marinaio, ma la mia memoria, purtroppo, non è delle migliori.~
@624  = ~Se la poesia non viene naturalmente come le foglie vengono agli alberi, allora è meglio che non venga per niente.~
@625  = ~Complimenti, Cernd. Hai appena fatto sprofondare la scarsa considerazione che avevo di te!~
@626  = ~Tu sei l'ultima persona con cui dovrebbe parlare! Fai parte di quella squallida congrega di bigotti che ha avuto il coraggio di ritenere ingiusta la nostra vendetta!~
@627  = ~Hai una responsabilità non indifferente nella sua corruzione, halfling. Se stato tu a farlo bere da un calice di menzogne che placasse la sua sete di giustizia.~
@628  = ~Il ragazzo ha sempre disprezzato le tue aspirazioni e la tua morale. Possibile che tu non ti sia accorto di come abbia sfruttato la tua debolezza per i suoi scopi?~
@629  = ~(Snort!) Il dolore avvicina le persone, pezzo d'idiota!~
@630  = ~Viconia, mia cara Viconia... Dormito bene?~
@631  = ~Chiudi la bocca, stupido essere di Superficie. La tua voce è uno strazio per le mie orecchie.~
@632  = ~Heh. Vedo che oggi sei di ottimo umore, Viccy.~
@633  = ~*Non* chiamarmi con quel ridicolo nome, idiota!~
@634  = ~Come desideri, Viccy.~
@635  = ~Ogni volta che entro in simili posti mi sento male. La visione di questi sciocchi fedeli prostrati in adorazione è a dir poco penosa!~
@636  = ~Al contrario, la devozione che provano nei confronti del loro dio è lodevole. Nulla di cui tu sia capace.~
@637  = ~Per fortuna. Che cosa ne ricaverei, Anomen? Illusioni? False speranze? Qualche incantesimo di convenienza?~
@638  = ~Fede. Nei momenti di maggiore difficoltà, la fede dà coraggio e determinazione, speranza e conforto; ti offre un appiglio a cui aggrapparti per andare avanti.~
@639  = ~Non vedo di che utilità possa essere per noi poveri eretici. In questo modo ne traete vantaggio soltanto voi guaritori.~
@640  = ~Quando sei sul punto di esalare l'ultimo respiro in battaglia è un chierico a salvarti la pelle. Ti è forse sfuggito, ladruncolo?~
@641  = ~Hai ragione. La prossima volta mi lascerò morire.~
@642  = ~Umpf. In quel momento non sarai così spavaldo. Fidati.~
@643  = ~Per fortuna quest'uomo si è offerto di mettere una buona parola su di noi. Sarebbe stato spiacevole doversi scontrare con dei compagni dell'Ordine.~
@644  = ~Spiacevole? Questo è il sogno di una vita! Ho sempre desiderato avere alle calcagne una dozzina di paladini!~
@645  = ~Una fantasia piuttosto bizzarra, halfling. Grazie a Torm rimarrà per sempre tale.~
@646  = ~Credi che il tuo dio mi impedirà di tagliuzzare i tuoi amichetti?~
@647  = ~Credo che sarà sufficiente il buon senso di <CHARNAME>. Non è forse vero, mio giovane amico?~
@648  = ~Verissimo, Keldorn. Non ho intenzione di scontrarmi con i membri del Cuore Radioso.~
@649  = ~Accetterò l'aiuto di Garren, se è questo che intendi.~
@650  = ~In realtà l'idea di Stivan non è niente male. Penso che sarebbe divertente massacrare qualche paladino.~
@651  = ~Io andrò per la mia strada, Keldorn. Se i tuoi compagni mi metteranno i bastoni tra le ruote, saprò come difendermi.~
@652  = ~(Urla) Dannati guastafeste! Se non sarà la mia lama a farli a fettine, ci penseranno i gabbiani con i loro becchi!~
@653  = ~Yeah! Così si fa!~
@654  = ~Mi auguro che le tue parole non vengano seguite dai fatti, <CHARNAME>. Sai bene che non esiterei a rivoltarmi contro di te se dovessi aggredire i miei compagni.~
@655  = ~Wow. Sono senza parole. Non pensavo che l'amore potesse vincere anche la morte.~
@656  = ~Conosco una poesia decisamente adatta alla vicenda di quei due. Vuoi sentirla, mio uccello di mare?~
@657  = ~Ti ascolto.~
@658  = ~"Quando bacio il tuo labbro profumato,
cara fanciulla, non posso obliare
che un bianco teschio vi è sotto celato".~
@659  = ~"Quando a me stringo il tuo corpo vezzoso,
obliar non poss'io, cara fanciulla, 
che vi è sotto uno scheletro celato".~
@660  = ~"E nell'orrenda visione assorto, 
dovunque o tocchi, o baci, o la man posi,
sento sporgere le fredde ossa di un morto".~
@661  = ~Ebbene? Che cosa ne pensi?~
@662  = ~Well, i tuoi versi rappresentano l'amore con una gelida oggettività, lo svuotano di tutto il suo calore. Sono... freddi.~
@663  = ~Al contrario, trovo che siano una commistione di erotismo e di necrofilia, di sensualità e di decadenza. Amore e morte formano un binomio inscindibile, un nodo che nessuna forza può allentare.~
@664  = ~Non è così, mia colomba?~
@665  = ~(Arrossisce)~
@666  = ~Se lo dici tu, Haer'Dalis...~
@667  = ~Sono stanca... Stiamo cammiando e lottando da tutta la giornata! Possiamo... Possiamo riposarci?~
@668  = ~Smettila di lamentarti, Aerie! Anch'io sono esausto, ma non passo il tempo a bofonchiare frasi del tipo "Le gambe mi fanno male" o "Non ho mai camminato così tanto in tutta la mia vita"!~
@669  = ~Ma... Ma io...~
@670  = ~Hai pure il coraggio di ribattere?~
@671  = ~M-ma insomma! Credo di avere il diritto di lamentarmi se sono stanca! E poi mi stavo rivolgendo a <CHARNAME>, non a te!~
@672  = ~Aerie! Stivan! Cosa sta succedendo?~
@673  = ~Tsk. Riesci a malapena ad articolare una frase di senso compiuto. Ma dove hai vissuto fin'ora? Il mondo ha posto e porrà ostacoli a ciascuno di noi, ma questo non è un motivo sufficiente per lamentarsi in continuazione!~
@674  = ~C-cosa ne sai te delle difficoltà che ho dovuto affrontare in passato? Io ho perso le mie ali! Tu non hai idea di che cosa si provi a vedersi strappare ciò che si ha di più caro!~
@675  = ~Oh, sono commosso. La nostra piccola elfa ha perso le ali... Poverina!~
@676  = ~N-non... Non prendermi in giro!~
@677  = ~Anch'io ho perso ciò che avevo di più caro, ma non mi abbandono a lamentele e a piagnistei pubblici. Il dolore è un'esperienza che si vive privatamente; declamare la propria afflizione mostra solo quanto una persona possa essere così egocentrica da voler attirare l'attenzione degli altri su di sè.~
@678  = ~Per quanto difficile possa essere stata la tua vita, questo non ti autorizza a sputare veleno sugli altri!~
@679  = ~Tu fatti gli affari tuoi!~
@680  = ~... Heh. Stavo scherzando, Mazzy. Non guardarmi in quel modo...~
@681  = ~Spero di essere stata chiara, Stivan.~
@682  = ~Er... Certo. Chiarissima.~
@683  = ~Toglimi una curiosità, Jaheira: i tuoi amici druidi hanno forse deciso di trastullarsi con gli abitanti del luogo?~
@684  = ~Sarebbe bene evitare giudizi affrettati, Stivan. Preferirei che non ci pronunciassimo su una situazione di cui sappiamo poco o nulla.~
@685  = ~Le cose non si considerano mai per quel che sono, ma per quel che appaiono.~
@686  = ~Piantala, halfling. Questo non è il momento adatto per una delle tue disquisizioni. Qualcuno o qualcosa minaccia di sconvolgere l'equilibrio di questo posto, ed io sono più che intenzionata a fermarlo!~
@687  = ~Jaheira, stai bene?~
@688  = ~Sono stata meglio, grazie. Essere maledetta non è certamente un'esperienza piacevole, ma preferirei morire piuttosto che dare a quel lurido schiavista la soddisfazione di sentirmi lamentare.~
@689  = ~Hai proprio una brutta cera, sai?~
@690  = ~Non sono... (Tossisce) ... Non sono dell'umore adatto per ascoltare i tuoi commenti sardonici, Stivan.~
@691  = ~Stavo scherzando, druida. Sai bene quanto ci tenga a te.~
@692  = ~Vuoi che ti seppellisca insieme a Ployer o preferisci una fossa a parte?~
@693  = ~Ehi, stavo parlando sul serio!~
@694  = ~Non... Non volevo essere così brusca. Questa maledizione sta avendo un brutto effetto sul mio carattere.~
@695  = ~Davvero? Io non noto alcuna differenza.~
@696  = ~... Quando perderò la pazienza, Stivan, farai bene a trovarti a miglia di distanza.~
@697  = ~Allora, Jaheira, come ti senti adesso?~
@698  = ~Per la barba di Silvanus, Stivan! Vuoi lasciarmi in pace?~
@699  = ~Ehi! Ti ho soltanto chiesto come stai!~
@700  = ~Credi che sia una sciocca? So bene che non aspetti altro che l'occasione per prenderti gioco di me!~
@701  = ~No, non stavolta. Io... Sono rimasto molto colpito dalla tua forza d'animo. Ultimamente ti sono capitate un sacco di sciagure, come la perdita di tuo marito o la maledizione di Ployer, eppure reagisci sempre con grinta e tenacia.~
@702  = ~Mi limito ad andare avanti, Stivan. C'è una vendetta che attende di essere compiuta.~
@703  = ~Sì, ma... Io non riesco ad essere forte come te. Sono passati molti anni dalla... dalla morte dei miei familiari, ma ancora non riesco a darmi pace.~
@704  = ~... Spesso accadono cose che sono come domande. Passano i giorni, oppure gli anni, e la vita risponde.~
@705  = ~Col tempo impari che l'amore non è appoggiarsi a qualcuno, che la compagnia non è sicurezza. Impari che i baci non sono contatti, che i doni non sono promesse.~
@706  = ~Il ripetersi delle stagioni ti insegna a costruire le strade oggi, perchè il terreno di domani è troppo incerto per fare piani; ti insegna che nella vita l'unica certezza è la morte, la sola cosa di cui non si può sapere nulla con certezza.~
@707  = ~E cominci ad accettare le sconfitte a testa alta, con gli occhi aperti e la grazia di un adulto, non con il dolore di un bambino.~
@708  = ~E impari che non puoi far altro che essere forte.~
@709  = ~Khalid...~
@710  = ~*SOB*!~
@711  = ~Non... Non era mia intenzione rattristarti, Stivan. Faresti meglio a rivolgerti ad altri per ottenere il conforto che cerchi. Io... Temo di non essere la persona più adatta.~
@712  = ~Jaheira, posso chiederti perchè hai deciso di unirti alla compagnia di <CHARNAME>?~
@713  = ~Quando Khalid ed io l'abbiamo incontrato per la prima volta, <CHARNAME> era un giovane inesperto e bisognoso di una guida. Gorion, il <PRO_HISHER> padre adottivo, ci aveva raccomandato più volte di prendercene cura se gli fosse successo qualcosa, e così è stato.~
@714  = ~Chi è Khalid?~
@715  = ~Khalid è... era mio marito.~
@716  = ~*Ahem* Che fine ha fatto? L'abbiamo perso per strada?~
@717  = ~Il tuo spirito è decisamente fuori luogo, ma lascerò correre. Mio marito è caduto per mano dello stregone di cui siamo alla ricerca, ed io non avrò pace sino a quando non sarà stato vendicato.~
@718  = ~Accidenti, mi dispiace. Non lo sapevo.~
@719  = ~Non c'era motivo per cui dovessi saperlo. Ora, se hai finito...~
@720  = ~Well, a questo punto non posso fare a meno di chiedermi un'altra cosa.~
@721  = ~Parla, se devi, ma non ti garantisco una risposta. Stai toccando ferite che non si sono ancora rimarginate.~
@722  = ~Hai pagato un alto prezzo per tener fede alla tua parola. Non voglio attribuire alcuna responsabilità a <CHARNAME>, ma se non avessi viaggiato con <PRO_HIMHER>...~
@723  = ~Dove vuoi arrivare con il tuo ragionamento, Stivan? A chiedermi se lo avrei aiutato pur sapendo che in questo modo mio marito sarebbe morto?~
@724  = ~Esattamente.~
@725  = ~Questa domanda non è degna di risposta. L'uccisione di Khalid... era il tassello di un disegno più grande e al di là della nostra comprensione. Soprattutto della tua!~
@726  = ~Ehi, non c'è bisogno di essere così aggressivi. Non dimenticare che anch'io ho perso i miei familiari.~
@727  = ~La mia rabbia è più che giustificata! Hanno assassinato Khalid! Hanno profanato il suo corpo, dividendomi per sempre da mio marito! Come potrei non essere adirata?~
@728  = ~Mi addolora solo... Il fatto di non essermi potuta offrire al suo posto.~
@729  = ~... Jaheira, io--~
@730  = ~No. Non voglio essere consolata.~
@731  = ~Dannazione! Vorrei uscire integro da questo posto! Stavo per perdere le braccia sotto i morsi di quelle bestiacce!~
@732  = ~Calmati, Stivan, o attirerai l'attenzione. Ci sono insidie ad ogni angolo qui, ed urlare in questo modo potrebbe essere pericoloso.~
@733  = ~E' troppo chiedere di tornare ad Athkatla con tutti gli arti attaccati?!~
@734  = ~E' troppo chiederti di non rivelare la nostra presenza ad ogni creaura che si trova in questo posto?~
@735  = ~Tu e il tuo dannato antenato! Finiremo per essere uccisi tutti!~
@736  = ~No, Stivan. Sarà Lavok ad essere ucciso una volta per tutte.~
@737  = ~(Urla) Basta! Non ne posso più di tutti questi mostri! Le mani mi stanno sanguinando per la fatica! La testa è sul punto di scoppiarmi! Come se non bastasse, ho addirittura finito la mia scorta di piume! Tutto per colpa della tua donna, ranger!~
@738  = ~Cosa?! Stai accusando Suna Seni della situazione in cui ci troviamo? E' stato quel mostro di Irenicus a costringerla a lavorare per lui!~
@739  = ~*Ahem* A me non sembra che sia stata costretta. Ha accettato in cambio di una cospicua somma, giusto?~
@740  = ~Nessuno di noi è innocente, Stivan. In questa storia siamo tutti colpevoli. Tutti. Ognuno a modo suo.~
@741  = ~Ma io non ho fatto niente!~
@742  = ~Allora chi non ha peccato scagli la prima pietra.~
@743  = ~... Eh?~
@744  = ~(Sigh) Lascia stare. Torniamo alla ricerca di una fuga da questo posto.~
@745  = ~M-Mazzy, li hai sentiti? Quei mostri volevano cibarsi delle nostre carni! Volevano banchettare con le *mie* e con le *tue* membra!~
@746  = ~Questo incontro mi ha lasciata confusa, Stivan, e anche un pò spaventata. Non avevo mai visto degli halfling... cannibali.~
@747  = ~Come possono voler mangiare dei loro simili?~
@748  = ~La fame è una brutta bestia. Suppongo che, se non li avessimo mai incontrati, alla fine si sarebbero divorati tra di loro.~
@749  = ~In effetti, credo che anch'io avrei rosicchiato qualche tuo arto piuttosto che morire d'inedia.~
@750  = ~Non posso dire lo stesso, Stivan. Cinico e pungente come sei, dubito che saresti commestibile.~
@751  = ~Sono contenta che Kram sia riuscito a trovare un lavoro onesto. Con un pò di costanza e di buona volontà, potrà finalmente costruirsi un futuro.~
@752  = ~Altre agili dita sottratte alla raffinata arte del borseggio... Dove andremo a finire?~
@753  = ~Con simili osservazioni, Stivan, non c'è da stupirsi se la maggior parte delle persone etichetta gli halfling come un popolo di ladri. Grazie ad Arvoreen, vicende come quella di Kram riescono a smussare questo genere di pregiudizi.~
@754  = ~Well, con un pò d'impegno dovrei riuscire a traviarlo...~
@755  = ~Sono convinta che non cederebbe a nessuna tentazione.~
@756  = ~E se sgrafignassi qualcosa a Galoomp sotto i suoi occhi? Questo potrebbe risvegliare l'antica abitudine...~
@757  = ~Quando ti comporti in questo modo, Stivan, sarei tentata di prenderti a schiaffi.~
@758  = ~Dici sul serio, venditrice di patat-- *OW*!~
@759  = ~Umpf. Stavolta te la sei cercata.~
@760  = ~(Sniff sniff) Cos’è questo fetore?~
@761  = ~Ogni angolo di questo posto è impregnato dell’odore del male. Suggerisco di avanzare con cautela.~
@762  = ~Heh. Io pensavo che avessi fatto una puzzetta, paladino!~
@763  = ~Eeekkk! C... Cos'è quel coso?!~
@764  = ~Eccolo. E' il drago che ha sconfitto me e i miei amici. Benchè Amuana ci abbia sconsigliato di affrontarlo, fremo dalla rabbia all'idea di risparmiare una creatura così malvagia!~
@765  = ~Combattici te se sei abbastanza folle da farlo! Io non ho intenzione di perdere la vita in una battaglia inutile come questa!~
@766  = ~Nessun halfling dovrebbe mai tirarsi indietro di fronte ad una prova di coraggio. Davide non ebbe alcuna esitazione ad affrontare Golia!~
@767  = ~Svegliati, Mazzy! La realtà è ben diversa da quella stupida favola per marmocchi insonni!~
@768  = ~(Resti in silenzio).~
@769  = ~Davide? Golia? Di chi state parlando?~
@770  = ~Uhmm... Ho già sentito questi nomi. Sbaglio o sono i protagonisti di un noto racconto halfling?~
@771  = ~Le mie orecchie riconoscono sempre il suono di una promettente leggenda. Raccontatemela, vi ascolto.~
@772  = ~Voi due, calmatevi. Non è il momento di agitarsi inutilmente.~
@773  = ~Quella storia, inventata o veritiera che sia, ha un insegnamento che faresti bene a ricordare. Lascia che ti rinfreschi la memoria.~
@774  = ~Non ce n’è bisogno, la conosco meglio di te!~
@775  = ~Si tratta dei protagonisti di una leggenda che le madri halfling son solite raccontarci in tenera età.~
@776  = ~Esatto, <CHARNAME>. Quella storia, inventata o veritiera che sia, ha un insegnamento che il nostro amico farebbe bene a ricordare. Lascia che gli rinfreschi la memoria.~
@777  = ~Nei pressi di un insediamento halfling a sud del Golfo di Vilhon si era stabilito un gruppo di giganti che terrorizzava le comunità del posto. Ad essere sincera, non ricordo con esattezza il nome del villaggio.~
@778  = ~(Snort!) Si trattava del Bosco di Chondal, ignorante!~
@779  = ~Visto che sai più dettagli di me, perché non prosegui?~
@780  = ~Puoi starne certa!~
@781  = ~*Ahem* Secondo questa leggenda, seguirono anni di lotte in cui gli halfling si divertivano a tagliuzzare le gambe degli avversari e i giganti a scagliare il più lontano possibile i nostri simili.~
@782  = ~La situazione rimase invariata sino a quando il campione dei nuovi arrivati, Golia, rivolse una vera e propria sfida agli halfling degli spiriti che abitavano il posto. La sua tribù avrebbe abbandonato il Bosco di Chondal soltanto se lui fosse stato sconfitto in combattimento.~
@783  = ~Nessuno ebbe il coraggio di accettare la sfida, ad eccezione di un tale di nome Davide.~
@784  = ~I due si incontrarono in una valle, conosciuta come la Valle di Elah. Certo di avere la vittoria in tasca, Golia lasciò che fosse l’avversario a fare la prima mossa.~
@785  = ~La sua presunzione gli fu fatale, in quanto Davide infilò la mano nella sua bisaccia, ne trasse una pietra, la lanciò con la fionda e colpì il gigante in fronte, facendolo cadere a terra. A quel punto corse in direzione dell’avversario, prese la sua spada e lo uccise tagliandogli la testa.~
@786  = ~(Sospiro) E fu così che gli halfling del Bosco di Chondal furono liberi dalla minaccia dei giganti, in quanto fuggirono alla notizia della morte del loro capo.~
@787  = ~Lo vedi, Stivan? Le idee ispirate dal coraggio sono come le pedine degli scacchi. Se da una parte possono essere mangiate, dall’altra possono anche dare avvio ad un gioco vincente.~
@788  = ~Non tutti sono dei Davide scesi nella Valle di Elah per affrontare un mostro tanto più grande e forte di noi. E non tutti hanno la capacità di uccidere il gigante. Di rado i cosiddetti "buoni" vincono e vivono per raccontarlo.~
@789  = ~Affronteremo il drago, Stivan, che ti piaccia o no.~
@790  = ~Si tratta di un nemico troppo pericoloso, Mazzy. Non lo sfideremo.~
@791  = ~Sceglierò cosa fare soltanto dopo aver studiato il nemico. Non è una decisione da prendere alla leggera.~
@792  = ~T-tu sei folle, <CHARNAME>, folle! Non voglio morire sbranato da quel mostro! Eeekkk!~
@793  = ~Non volevo suggerire nulla del genere, <CHARNAME>. Ho già affrontato quella bestia, e so bene quanto sia forte. Il problema è che... Sento le grida dei miei compagni caduti. Chiedono giustizia.~
@794  = ~E l’avranno. Il Signore delle Ombre pagherà per gli orrori di cui è responsabile.~
@795  = ~Riconoscere i propri limiti è segno di saggezza. Non ha senso sprecare le nostre vite attaccandolo; ci rivarremo sul padrone di questa orrida bestia.~
@796  = ~Così sia. Preparati, Stivan: combatteremo contro il drago.~
@797  = ~Capisco cosa dici, ma è meglio proseguire. Abbiamo indugiato sin troppo qui.~
@798  = ~Ci deve pure pensare, come se la scelta migliore non fosse già ovvia. Well, mentre tu fai le tue riflessioni, io mediterò su quale sia il posto migliore in cui nascondermi, okay?~
@799  = ~Testa di latta, è da ben *due* ore che non mi lustri! Cosa stai aspettando?!~
@800  = ~Abbi un attimo di pazienza, Larry: Minsc sta dando da mangiare a Boo. Tra poco si prenderà cura anche di te.~
@801  = ~Ora! Mi devi lucidare ORA, prima che la ruggine mi intacchi!~
@802  = ~E va bene. Boo, finisci di mangiare le noci da solo; Minsc deve dare una pulitina alla sua spada.~
@803  = ~Devi essere proprio stupido, ranger, per soddisfare ogni capriccio di quella lama. Se si fosse rivolta a me in questo modo, l'avrei rigirata in una pila di letame fino ad insegnarle un pò di rispetto.~
@804  = ~Minsc non è stupido! Si prende cura del suo criceto e della sua spada per essere sempre pronto alla battaglia!~
@805  = ~Ora basta! Se non posso ricevere la dovuta pulizia, allora assaggerò un pò di sangue!~
@806  = ~OW! Minsc, sei impazzito?!?~
@807  = ~Minsc non ha fatto nulla! E' stato Larry! Vero, Boo?~
@808  = ~Nulla? Stavi per tagliarmi in due e hai il coraggio di dire che non hai fatto nulla?! Stai brandendo TU quella dannata spada! Ti è forse sfuggito?~
@809  = ~Ma Larry ogni tanto fa quel che vuole! Minsc non ha colpa se la sua spada sferra colpi da sola!~
@810  = ~Osa solo colpirmi un'altra volta, spada, e ti rispedisco nelle fogne da cui provieni!~
@811  = ~Mwahahahahahaha!~
@812  = ~WOW! Questo corpo è... E' incredibile! Sto scoprendo e facendo un sacco di cose che prima non mi erano possibili! Non trovi che sia magnifico, Mazzy?~
@813  = ~Non capisco il tuo entusiasmo. Io provo un gran disagio al pensiero di avere le sembianze di una creatura malvagia.~
@814  = ~Di quale disagio vai parlando? Essere alti ed essere drow ha tantissimi vantaggi!~
@815  = ~Non hai peli sui piedi.~
@816  = ~Non hai gambe e braccia a forma di coscia di pollo.~
@817  = ~Non hai il torcicollo derivante dal dover alzare la testa ogni volte che parli con qualcuno.~
@818  = ~Puoi fare dei passi incredibilmente lunghi.~
@819  = ~Puoi brandire quelle armi che prima erano più grandi di te.~
@820  = ~Puoi afferrare gli oggetti da un tavolo senza doverti mettere in punta di piedi.~
@821  = ~Puoi... Puoi fare un sacco di cose!~
@822  = ~(Sospira) Goditi quest'esperienza finchè puoi, allora. Presto riassumeremo le nostre vere sembianze, lo sai.~
@823  = ~Heh. Questo è quello che *tu* pensi.~
@824  = ~Cosa vorresti dire?~
@825  = ~Chiederò a quel simpatico draghetto di lasciare immutata la mia forma.~
@826  = ~Cosa?! Vorresti mantenere le fattezze di un drow? Sarebbe questo il tuo sogno nel cassetto?~
@827  = ~Io non ho sogni nel cassetto, Mazzy. Preferisco tenerci la biancheria!~
@828  = ~Non è il momento di scherzare, Stivan! L'incantesimo lanciato da Aldalon non è altro che un'illusione. Non cambierà mai la tua natura di halfling!~
@829  = ~Hai pensato inoltre alle conseguenze che il tuo aspetto porterebbe con sè? Una volta tornati in superficie, le persone ne saranno terrorizzate e ti eviteranno. Alcuni cercheranno addirittura di ucciderti!~
@830  = ~(Snort!) E allora? Lo scenario che dipingi non sarebbe poi tanto diverso da quello che ho vissuto sino ad oggi!~
@831  = ~Le persone mi hanno sempre evitato per il mio aspetto trasandato, come se avessi potuto tirarmi a lucido dopo la perdita di tutti i miei beni. Quanto ai tentativi di uccisione, sono innumerevoli le guardie che hanno cercato di aggredirmi e di sbattermi in prigione soltanto perchè dormivo per strada. "Dobbiamo mantenere l'ordine e la sicurezza" dicevano, quando i problemi del distretto erano altri!~
@832  = ~Ben venga se coloro che incontrerò avranno paura di me per le mie sembianze da drow. Il loro timore sarà sinonimo di rispetto!~
@833  = ~Stivan, calmati e ascoltami.~
@834  = ~Capisco meglio di chiunque altro quanto sia difficile per un halfling essere accettati dalla società. Agli occhi dei più non siamo altro che creature buffe e frivole, pavide e vigliacche. Eppure, io ho lottato perchè almeno nel mio mondo le cose cambiassero, perchè le persone mi vedessero per quel che sono veramente, non con le lenti dei pregiudizi che accompagnano il nome della nostra razza.~
@835  = ~E' stato un cammino lungo e periglioso, non lo nego. In più occasioni mi sono sentita demoralizzata, ma ogni volta sono riuscita ad andare avanti dicendomi: "Sei caduta sette volte? Rialzati otto". Alla fine, ho dimostrato a me stessa e agli altri di essere una persona forte e coraggiosa, leale e onesta.~
@836  = ~... Heh. Ci hai provato, Mazzy, ma non mi lascerò intortare dalla tua storiellina. Io manterrò quest'aspetto, che ti piaccia o no!~
@837  = ~Ragiona, Sti--~
@838  = ~(Urla) Basta! Non voglio sentire altro!~
@839  = ~Vedi, Mazzy? *Vedi* come questi sbruffoni mi fissano? Se avessi mantenuto l'aspetto di un drow non mi guarderebbero con quell'espressione di sfacciata superiorità!~
@840  = ~Hai ragione. Ti avrebbero piantato al suolo con lance e frecce.~
@841  = ~Osserva e impara.~
@842  = ~Ehi, tu! Posso sapere perchè guardi in quel modo il mio amico? Non ti hanno insegnato che è maleducato fissare le persone senza dir nulla?~
@843  = ~Guardo dove mi pare, donnetta.~
@844  = ~Ne sei sicuro? Vuoi che venga lì e ti faccia volgere lo sguardo altrove a suon di schiaffi?~
@845  = ~Er... No. Non ce n'è bisogno...~
@846  = ~Presto fatto.~
@847  = ~Sii coraggioso, Stivan. Anche gli halfling, nel cercare di scalare la più alta delle vette, possono raggiungerne la cima.~
@848  = ~(Arrossisce) Grazie, Mazzy.~
@849  = ~Figurati.~
@850  = ~Non dovresti esporti così tanto in battaglia, halfling. Ti mancano tattica e disciplina, due abilità fondamentali negli scontri corpo a corpo.~
@851  = ~La prossima volta lascia a me gli avversari più robusti: saprò sistemarli a dovere. Ora, è meglio che ti curi.~
@852  = ~Heh. Grazie.~
@853  = ~Comunque avevi ragione.~
@854  = ~Riguardo a cosa?~
@855  = ~E' solo quando cominci a temere veramente la morte che impari ad apprezzare i chierici.~
@856  = ~Pronto alla battaglia?~
@857  = ~Heh. Puoi contarci.~
@858  = ~Fà tesoro dei miei insegnamenti. Dovremo fare il possibile per proteggere <CHARNAME> - impazzirei se le dovesse succedere qualcosa.~
@859  = ~... Perchè tieni così tanto a lei?~
@860  = ~L'amore che nutro per <CHARNAME> è una rosa che ad ogni alba mostra un petalo nuovo e un colore diverso, ma la sua bellezza è quella di sempre. Nessun artista saprebbe dipingere il sapore dei suoi baci, il profumo della sua pelle, la melodia della sua voce. Io stesso non son degno di cantare la poesia del suo nome.~
@861  = ~Per lei sono pronto a dare la vita.~
@862  = ~Fà tesoro dei miei insegnamenti. Dovremo fare il possibile per proteggere <CHARNAME>.~
@863  = ~... Sono sicuro che sia in grado di cavarsela anche da sè.~
@864  = ~Non ne dubito, ma è nostro dovere difenderlo ad ogni costo.~
@865  = ~(Gasp!) Non puoi promettere una cosa simile!~
@866  = ~Non preoccuparti, amico mio. Ci vuole ben altro che un mago da strapazzo per mettermi in difficoltà. Ma basta indugiare: la battaglia ci aspetta.~
@867  = ~<CHARNAME>...! <CHARNAME>, ti prego, non lasciare che Anomen muoia! Per favore!~
@868  = ~Non gli accadrà nulla. Avremo la meglio su quel folle una volta per tutte.~
@869  = ~Tranquillo, Stivan. Avrò un occhio di riguardo nei suoi confronti.~
@870  = ~Farò il possibile per proteggere ogni membro di questo gruppo. E' il minimo che possa fare dopo tutto il sostegno che mi avete dato.~
@871  = ~Tranquillo, Stivan: avrò un occhio di riguardo nei suoi confronti. E' troppo importante per me.~
@872  = ~Non so se riusciremo ad avere la meglio su Irenicus, ma fammi un favore: se dovesse succedermi qualcosa, non permettere che Anomen compia dei gesti avventati.~
@873  = ~(Sniff) Perchè all'improvviso provo tutta questa paura? Mi stavo dirigendo intrepido verso lo scontro e adesso... Adesso ho il terrore che quel pazzoide possa farci del male!~
@874  = ~Se non dovessi farcela, vorrei... Vorrei riposare nella stessa cripta dove si trovano i miei familiari. Se invece dovesse succedere qualcosa ad Anomen e tu non avrai la decenza di accompagnarlo nella morte, ti ridurrò a fettine!~
@875  = ~Quindi se tu dovessi morire mi autorizzi a tramortirlo e a riportarlo sano e salvo ad Athkatla? E' questo che intendi?~
@876  = ~Esat--~
@877  = ~In realt--~
@878  = ~Non propr--~
@879  = ~Yeah! Sei fenomenale, <CHARNAME>! Cosa aspetti lì imbambolata? Andiamo!~
@880  = ~(Gasp!) Quelle creature erano *mostruose*! Mi fa male la testa... E' come se l'avessero presa a frustate!~
@881  = ~Bah! Il Sottosuolo non è un posto adatto a femminucce come te! Fatti da parte e lascia che siano i veri guerrieri a fare il lavoro sporco!~
@882  = ~Sono perfettamente capace di cavarmela, Korgan. Ho soltanto bisogno di tempo per abituarmi a queste nuove sembianze.~
@883  = ~L'aspetto non significa nulla, inutile mucchietto di sputi goblin. Anche con le fattezze di un lurido gambelunghe drow so bene dove affondare la mia ascia.~
@884  = ~Proprio qui... All'altezza del tuo collo!~
@885  = ~Eeeekkkk!!!~
@886  = ~Har har! Guarda come corre, il bambinetto!~
@887  = ~Per Arvoreen, Korgan! Ti rendi conto che spaventare un membro del nostro gruppo è soltanto controproducente?~
@888  = ~Avanti, Mazzy... Goditi lo spasso!~
@889  = ~Ci sono degli sciocchi che sfruttano abilmente la loro stupidità. Mi hai appena dato l'ennesima prova di essere uno di questi.~
@890  = ~Io... Non mi sento molto bene...~
@891  = ~<CHARNAME>, spero che tu abbia intenzione di fare qualcosa per strappare il nostro amico dal gelido abbraccio della morte. Non dubito che sia una creatura troppo strana per vivere, ma è anche troppo rara per morire.~
@892  = ~Accidenti. Il sangue delle mie ferite ha addirittura insozzato le mie piume.~
@893  = ~Minsc ammira il tuo coraggio, ma non vuole che il suo piccolo amico si esponga così tanto nelle battaglie! Dovresti fare compagnia a Boo nelle retrofile, di tanto in tanto.~
@894  = ~Perchè ti preoccupi di me, Minsc? Io... Non credo di meritare la tua apprensione.~
@895  = ~Questo ranger e questo criceto credono che tu sia cattivo solo all'apparenza, e puoi star certo che hanno visto il male così tante volte da non potersi sbagliare!~
@896  = ~Boo aggiunge che ogni tanto ti meriteresti una lavata di capo però.~
@897  = ~Heh. Forse ho sbagliato a giudicarti, ranger. Dopo tutto... Sei una brava persona.~
@898  = ~Minsc e Boo si stanno chiedendo come mai il loro piccolo amico sia così felice ultimamente.~
@899  = ~Questo corpo è un vero spasso! Ogni semplice gesto, dal camminare al respirare, mi sembra nuovo e completamente diverso!~
@900  = ~Minsc non si sente a suo agio nell'indossare i vestiti altrui. Inoltre dare i calci al male con queste gambine è molto più difficile!~
@901  = ~E Boo cosa dice?~
@902  = ~Boo teme che se i suoi piccoli amici lo vedessero così nero scapperebbero dalla paura.~
@903  = ~*Squeak!*~
@904  = ~Senti com'è preoccupato?~
@905  = ~Heh. A quanto pare sono il solo ad essere così entusiasta di queste nuove sembianze. Meglio così... Non ci saranno altri che avanzeranno la mia stessa richiesta a quella simpatica lucertola troppo cresciuta!~
@906  = ~(Gasp!) Cos'è quest'ansia improvvisa? Perchè mi sento così agitato?~
@907  = ~Immagino che il tuo animo sia in trepidante attesa che venga fatta giustizia, esattamente come il mio. Vieni; non perdiamo altro tempo in chiacchiere.~
@908  = ~Forse... E' meglio che ti aspetti qui. Non ho più il controllo dei battiti del mio cuore, e tempo che potrebbe scoppiarmi se sentissi con le mie orecchie le parole di condanna del magistrato.~
@909  = ~Ti aspetterò qui. Cercherò di tranquillizzarmi, e al tuo arrivo... Ascolterò ciò che hai da dire.~
@910  = ~Come vuoi. <CHARNAME>, andiamo.~
@911  = ~*Ahem* Com'è andata, Anomen? Cosa ti ha detto il magistrato?~
@912  = ~Questa corte non farà nulla per vendicare la morte di Moira.~
@913  = ~Cosa?! Il magistrato non farà nulla? Lascerà Saerk impunito?~
@914  = ~No, non lo permetterò. La morte di Moira sarà vendicata!~
@915  = ~(Snort!) Se le cose stanno così, allora abbatteremo Saerk a colpi di ferro e piume!~
@916  = ~<CHARNAME>, al Quartiere del Ponte, presto.~
@917  = ~Non sappiamo con certezza se sia stato veramente lui. Potrebbe trattarsi di una fantasia di mio padre, generata dal rancore che serba per lui.~
@918  = ~(Snort!) Sei impazzito? La prova della sua colpevolezza sta proprio nel fatto che *non* ci sono prove! E' tipico di Saerk premurarsi di non lasciare tracce che conducano a lui! L'ha fatto anche con me!~
@919  = ~Non... Non lascerò che il dolore della perdita di mia sorella offuschi la mia capacità di giudizio. Una simile vendetta, basata su supposizioni, è contro i dettami dell'Ordine, ed io non la perseguirò.~
@920  = ~Tu... Tu mi hai mentito! Avevi detto che avremmo punito quell'infame, e invece ti sei tirato indietro!~
@921  = ~Basta! Ho preso la mia decisione e non cederò ai ripensamenti! I tuoi trascorsi con quell'uomo non mi riguardano!~
@922  = ~(Urla) Tu sia maledetto, Anomen! Hai appena negato una giusta vendetta per il tuo capriccio personale! Non ti perdonerò mai per questo!~
@923  = ~Non so che farmene dei tuoi schiamazzi, halfling. Ora vattene, prima che perda la pazienza!~
@924  = ~(Snort!) E va bene, Anomen. Se è questo che vuoi, me ne andrò. Vedere la tua faccia da schiaffi mi fa impazzire dalla rabbia!~
@925  = ~Stai commettendo un grosso errore, Stivan. Il responsabile delle vostre tragedie è il medesimo, ma i risvolti sono diversi. Se Anomen vendicasse la morte di sua sorella con l'omicidio, si macchierebbe di un reato imperdonabile per l'Ordine. Tu non avresti un simile problema.~
@926  = ~Calmati, Stivan. La situazione è complicata, ma non risolverai nulla nè andandotene nè invocando vendetta.~
@927  = ~Cerca di essere ragionevole, Stivan. Un tuo problema non può condizionare il problema di un altro. Devono essere ben distinti. Anomen non può vendicare un torto che non gli appartiene perchè altrimenti le conseguenze ricadrebbero su di lui.~
@928  = ~E a me? A me non pensi?~
@929  = ~*SOB*! Mia mamma diceva sempre che è impossibile non piangere quando si grida all'ingiustizia, e aveva ragione! Tu lo appoggi nella sua decisione, e questo mi ferisce ancor più del suo rifiuto di aiutarmi!~
@930  = ~Il mio viaggio al tuo fianco termina qui, <CHARNAME>. Credevo che fossi mio amico, ma dalle tue parole capisco che mi sbagliavo. Addio!~
@931  = ~Come un insidioso manto di nubi oscure si allontana dopo la tempesta, così la minaccia di Faldorn è stata scongiurata per sempre.~
@932  = ~Ciò nonostante, pare che la Natura sia ingiustamente accusata di un altro crimine. Dico bene, Stivan?~
@933  = ~Cos'è questo, un tentativo di socializzazione? Spiacente, ma non ho la benchè minima intenzione di sprecare fiato con te.~
@934  = ~In qualità di druido, è mio dovere intervenire per ripristinare l'Equilibrio e aprire i tuoi occhi alla luce della verità. Lungo il nostro cammino crescerai, e insieme daremo senso e significato alle tue tragedie.~
@935  = ~(Snort!) Non c'è bisogno di ricorrere a simili espedienti verbali per darmi dell'immaturo! Non sono uno stupido, e so riconoscere un insulto!~
@936  = ~Ogni creazione della Madre è o è stata immatura. Esistono germogli che non giungono a fiorire? O alberi che non fruttificano?~
@937  = ~Chiudi la bocca, druido! Stà zitto!~
@938  = ~Presto inizieremo il nostro percorso. Molto presto.~
@939  = ~Heh. Pare che le nubi siano tornate, druido, ma questa volta per addensarsi sulla tua testa. Sbaglio o la patata bollente che hai tra le mani ti impedirà di seccarmi per un pò con i tuoi stupidi discorsi?~
@940  = ~Ti sbagli. Non posso permettere che la mia vita personale intralci i miei doveri di druido. Il nostro cammino comincia adesso.~
@941  = ~Oh, no!~
@942  = ~Esaminiamo l'avvenimento che ha segnato l'inizio del tuo astio nei confronti dei gabbiani. Ripercorriamo istante per istante ciò che ti successe anni fa, come se stessimo passando a setaccio i petali di un fiore.~
@943  = ~(Snort!) Stai abusando della mia pazienza, tu! Chi diavolo credi di essere per esigere che ti racconti la storia dell'uccisione dei miei familiari?~
@944  = ~Non scambiare per presunzione il mio tentativo di giungere alla verità. Al momento stai navigando nelle acque dell'ignoranza, ed è mio dovere fare in modo che i venti del destino spingano le tue vele verso il mare della conoscenza.~
@945  = ~Ora capisco dove vuoi arrivare. Tu... Tu stai mettendo in discussione la colpevolezza dei gabbiani!~
@946  = ~Dei semplici uccelli marini non potrebbero mai macchiarsi di un crimine come l'uccisione di un'innocente famiglia. Non è nella loro natura.~
@947  = ~Evidentemente quel giorno devono essere caduti in preda a degli istinti carnivori, dato che li ho visti pasteggiare con i resti dei miei familiari!~
@948  = ~Esatto, Stivan. Tu sostieni di averli visti mentre si cibavano, non mentre uccidevano i tuoi genitori e i tuoi fratelli.~
@949  = ~... Non cercare di ingannarmi con subdoli giri di parole. Sono stati i gabbiani ad ucciderli e a profanare i loro corpi! Sono stati loro!~
@950  = ~Il seme del dubbio è stato gettato, e a tempo debito metterà radici.~
@951  = ~Il dubbio è dipinto sul tuo volto, Stivan.~
@952  = ~Immagino di dover ringraziare te per questo.~
@953  = ~Non posso evitare che gli uccelli dell'ansia e della preoccupazione volino sulla tua testa, ma farò il possibile perchè non vi cotruiscano un nido di paure.~
@954  = ~Questa potevi anche risparmiartela!~
@955  = ~In realtà credo che ritragga con precisione il tuo stato d'animo. Sei atterrito dalla possibilità che le creature della Madre possano non essere responsabili della scomparsa dei tuoi familiari, e questo ti spaventa.~
@956  = ~(Snort!) Se non sono stati i gabbiani ad uccidere i miei familiari, allora chi ha posto fine alla loro vita? Soprattutto, *perchè*?~
@957  = ~Ecco dove volevo arrivare, Stivan. La prima tappa del nostro percorso è stata infine raggiunta.~
@958  = ~Potrei sapere qual è lo scopo di questa conversazione delirante, a parte quello di confondermi le idee?~
@959  = ~Hai appena capito che dietro ad ogni cosa si dispiega sempre un ventaglio di possibilità. Ti sei interrogato su una verità che ti appariva sicura, l'hai messa in discussione e sei giunto ad una conclusione che al momento non ti offre risposte.~
@960  = ~Il sentiero verso la seconda tappa è aperto.~
@961  = ~(Gasp!) Questo posto... E' una colonia del nemico pennuto!~
@962  = ~I gabbiani nidificano in ambienti marini quali scogliere, isole e coste, pertanto è comprensibile che qui siano numerosi.~
@963  = ~Hanno uno sguardo feroce!~
@964  = ~A dire il vero, i gabbiani di Athkatla sono molto più aggressivi, e non occorre faticare tanto per capire il perchè. Il progressivo inurbamento dei Moli ha violato il loro habitat, tant'è che i loro nidi sono comparsi addirittura sopra i tetti di alcune abitazioni dell'entroterra.~
@965  = ~Sono di tutti i tipi!~
@966  = ~E' vero. Quello è un gabbiano corallino, noto per la facilità con cui si insedia sulle scogliere più insidiose. Vedi quell'altro? E' un gabbiano roseo, facilmente avvistabile in ambienti ad altà salinità.~
@967  = ~E per finire...~
@968  = ~Quello che si è appena appoggiato sulla mia spalla è un comune esemplare di gabbiano. Vuoi chiedergli qualcosa?~
@969  = ~Sei impazzito, Cernd?~
@970  = ~Coraggio; vi farò da tramite.~
@971  = ~Well... Ecco, io... Non saprei...~
@972  = ~Una domanda qualsiasi andrà bene.~
@973  = ~D'accordo, d'accordo.~
@974  = ~*Ahem* Sei un maschio... Oppure una femmina?~
@975  = ~E' un maschio. E' in attesa che le uova della sua compagna si schiudano.~
@976  = ~Avanti, guardalo più da vicino.~
@977  = ~Stai scherzando? Mi perforerà la faccia!~
@978  = ~Non lo farà, Stivan. Non ha motivo di esserti ostile.~
@979  = ~Heh. Tutto sommato... Ha una faccia simpatica.~
@980  = ~Prego, continuate pure. In fin dei conti, ho soltanto un'amica da salvare e uno stregone da ammazzare, ma che importa?~
@981  = ~Stivan, sei sicuro di stare bene?~
@982  = ~Stento a crederci, Cernd. Sei riuscito a placare il suo odio per i gabbiani!~
@983  = ~"E fu così che l'halfling depose il suo odio per il nemico pennuto". Potrei scriverci un romanzo, eh?~
@984  = ~Co...~
@985  = ~Cosa diavolo sta succedendo? Cosa ci fa quest'uccellaccio ad un palmo dal mio naso? Via, via!~
@986  = ~No!~
@987  = ~(Gasp!) Stavo per essere assoggettato al nemico pennuto!~
@988  = ~I gabbiani! Ci hanno circondati! All'attacco!!~
@989  = ~(Sospira) <CHARNAME>, tu... Tu hai appena vanificato tutti i miei sforzi. So bene che non era tua intenzione e non voglio fartene una colpa, ma ti pregherei di non interferire più in futuro.~
@990  = ~In qualità di servo della Natura, mi aspetto che tu capisca quanto sia importante difendere queste creature dal rancore esacerbante di Stivan. Se il nostro percorso procederà senza intoppi, presto anche lui verrà educato all'Equilibrio.~
@991  = ~Non sei un servo della Natura, pertanto non mi aspetto che tu capisca quanto sia importante difendere queste creature dal rancore esacerbante di Stivan. Ad ogni modo, se il nostro percorso procederà senza intoppi, presto verrà educato all'Equilibrio e al rispetto delle creature della Madre, com'è giusto che sia.~
@992  = ~Non posso credere che tu abbia ucciso l'unico drow amichevole in questo posto!~
@993  = ~I gabbiani che uccidi sono ugualmente amichevoli, e alle mie orecchie giungono grida simili ogni volta che ne uccidi uno.~
@994  = ~Mi stava simpatico. Grazie, <CHARNAME>, di averlo risparmiato nonostante il rischio che correvi.~
@995  = ~Così come <CHARNAME> ha risparmiato una vita correndo un rischio così grave, non dovresti allo stesso modo risparmiare le vite dei gabbiani?~
@996  = ~Non vedo l'ora di tornare alla superficie! Prepara il fuoco, <CHARNAME>, stasera vado a caccia e poi stufato di gabbiano per tutti!~
@997  = ~E' nella natura dell'uomo uccidere per nutrirsi. Tuttavia, dubito che quello sia il vero scopo delle tue uccisioni.~
@998  = ~Fatti gli affari tuoi, Cernd!~
@999  = ~La Natura è affare mio, così come è insegnarne il rispetto.~
@1000 = ~E' ora di riprendere il nostro cammino.~
@1001 = ~No, non lo è!~
@1002 = ~Dimmi, Stivan, quando sono morti i tuoi genitori?~
@1003 = ~Morirono otto anni fa, e lo ricordo come se fosse ieri!~
@1004 = ~E chi li ha uccisi?~
@1005 = ~Ma che domande fai? Fu uno stormo di gabbiani, e lo sai meglio di me!~
@1006 = ~Ammettiamo anche che ciò sia vero - ebbene, sappi che i gabbiani non vivono mai più di tre anni.~
@1007 = ~Anche se tu uccidessi tutti i gabbiani che vivono oggi, non ucciderai mai quelli che tu ritieni abbiano ucciso i tuoi genitori.~
@1008 = ~Io...~
@1009 = ~Dì quello che pensi, anche se temi di dirlo.~
@1010 = ~Io mi vendicherò uccidendo i loro figli! E i figli dei loro figli! E...~
@1011 = ~Come le radici di una pianta divorano la più dura delle rocce con la sola forza della pazienza, così i miei insegnamenti divoreranno il tuo odio. Abbiamo seminato abbastanza per oggi.~
@1012 = ~Il tuo primo dialogo con un gabbiano è stato bruscamente interrotto.~
@1013 = ~Ecco, questo è un gabbiano dalla testa rosa, noto per legarsi per tutta la vita ai suoi parenti - legami più saldi di quelli tra parenti umani. Hai qualche domanda da porgli, Stivan?~
@1014 = ~Ecco, io...~
@1015 = ~Non esitare, Stivan. Solo parlando col tuo nemico potrai conoscerlo e terminare il tuo conflitto.~
@1016 = ~(Snort!) Lo faccio a condizione che dopo tu chiuda la bocca una volta per tutte.~
@1017 = ~Allora... Tu sei un maschio o una femmina?~
@1018 = ~E' una femmina. Ha appena lasciato i cuccioli sotto la cura del maschio ed è andata in cerca di cibo.~
@1019 = ~Ah sì? E dove lo cerchi, uccidendo i bambini nelle culle? O preferisci attaccare gli uomini adulti?~
@1020 = ~Perché scappa? Si vergogna delle sue colpe?~
@1021 = ~(sigh) Ha detto che non può cercare cibo vicino a dove abitano gli uomini, a causa del Cacciatore. Ti deve aver riconosciuto.~
@1022 = ~Yeah! Allora la mia reputazione si sta diffondendo! Presto Atkhatla sarà libera dalla minaccia!~
@1023 = ~Come l'ora più scura è quella che precede l'alba, così l'odio è più profondo prima della riconciliazione. Il nostro percorso sta per terminare.~
@1024 = ~Cernd, potresti attirare un'altro gabbiano? Ora so che cosa dirgli.~
@1025 = ~Vedo che i nostri semi stanno germogliando. Soddisferò subito la tua richiesta.~
@1026 = ~Ecco. Questo gabbiano dalla coda nera ha fatto un viaggio estremamente lungo nella sua vita - è solito nidificare nelle remote terre di Halruaa. E' estremamente longevo, vi sono esemplari che raggiungono i cinquanta anni.~
@1027 = ~Mi hai mentito! Quando mi avevi detto che i gabbiani non vivono mai più di tre anni, mi hai mentito!~
@1028 = ~Potrebbe essere stato lui ad aver attaccato i miei genitori!~
@1029 = ~La menzogna non è un atto malvagio se è commesso a fin di bene.~
@1030 = ~Taci! Non ti voglio sentire!~
@1031 = ~Come la Natura perdona il leone per le sue uccisioni, così possa la Grande Madre perdonare me per questo inammissibile errore. Spero che i semi piantati fin'ora siano più forti di questo sbaglio.~
@1032 = ~Cernd, scusami per averti attaccato. Se hai mentito, lo hai fatto solo a fin di bene.~
@1033 = ~Ti ringrazio per la tua comprensione.~
@1034 = ~Ora dim---~
@1035 = ~*splash*~
@1036 = ~In faccia me l'hai fatta, uccellaccio? Allora volete la guerra! Vieni qui che ti spenno, tu e il tuo amico!~
@1037 = ~Come una mattina di gelo non uccide il germoglio sano, così i tuoi germogli di pietà non verranno uccisi da questo incidente. La fioritura è ormai prossima.~
@1038 = ~Sei pronto, Stivan? Stiamo per raggiungere l’ultima tappa del nostro lungo percorso. Non avrei mai immaginato che avresti tratto le tue ultime considerazioni qui, all’Inferno, ma se tale è il volere del destino, io non mi opporrò.~
@1039 = ~Dobbiamo proprio, Cernd? Questo posto... Mi mette i brividi.~
@1040 = ~Come <CHARNAME> sta affrontando delle prove che lo porteranno ad interrogarsi su se stesso e sul suo ruolo, così è di fondamentale importanza che tu faccia altrettanto.~
@1041 = ~Ripercorriamo un’ultima volta le considerazioni maturate nel corso del nostro cammino.~
@1042 = ~Dimmi, Stivan: hai idea di chi abbia posto fine alla vita dei tuoi familiari?~
@1043 = ~*Ahem* No.~
@1044 = ~Non erano forse i gabbiani?~
@1045 = ~Non sono stati loro, Cernd. Questo ormai l’ho capito.~
@1046 = ~E lascerai irrisolto il mistero della loro morte?~
@1047 = ~Probabilmente non saprò mai chi è il responsabile della loro morte, ma non posso restare ancorato al passato. Ho trascurato fin troppo il presente, e ho capito che è il momento di guardare al futuro. Me ne sono reso conto quando ho riposto le ceneri dei miei familiari nella cripta.~
@1048 = ~Cosa ti attende ora?~
@1049 = ~Heh. Questa è una bella domanda.~
@1050 = ~Non mi basta come risposta.~
@1051 = ~Cernd, siamo all'Inferno. Devo ancora capire se son vivo o morto!~
@1052 = ~Immagina un domani in cui i rami degli alberi ti accarezzano con le loro verdi foglie; un domani in cui la primavera scrive nell'umidità il delirante alfabeto del tempo che ritorna, mentre l'alba fa spuntare primule e tulipani attorno a te. Riesci a vederti in uno scenario come questo?~
@1053 = ~Probabilmente all'inizio starnutirò tutto il tempo, ma quando mi ci sarò abituato potrei trovarmi a mio agio.~
@1054 = ~Un’ultima domanda. ~
@1055 = ~Mi fa male la testa, Cernd. Non sono abituato a pensare così tanto.~
@1056 = ~Abbiamo quasi terminato. Cosa ne pensi della vita?~
@1057 = ~Heh. Questa è difficile. Un'aiutino?~
@1058 = ~Tua è la risposta.~
@1059 = ~Well, ecco... Sino a poco tempo fa, ti avrei detto che è il più aspro dei campi di battaglia; adesso, invece, considero la vita come un palcoscenico dove ciascuno deve recitare la sua parte.~
@1060 = ~E tu sei intenzionato a prendere tra le mani un copione?~
@1061 = ~Penso di sì.~
@1062 = ~Molto bene, Stivan. Non c'è altro da aggiungere. La meta del nostro cammino è stata infine raggiunta. Possano la saggezza della Madre, Chauntea, e del Padre, Silvanus, accompagnarti verso ciò che ti attende.~
@1063 = ~... Posso dirti una cosa, Cernd?~
@1064 = ~Certamente.~
@1065 = ~I tuoi capelli sono più lunghi delle liane. Posso dargli un'accorciata?~
@1066 = ~Prima dovremmo aiutare <CHARNAME> a recuperare le Lacrime di Bhaal e la sua anima. Poi... Vedremo.~
@1067 = ~Eccoci! Era da un pezzo che non mettevo i miei piedini pelosi in questo posto. Samuel, l'halfling di cui ti parlavo, è lì al bancone. Andiamo a salutarlo.~
@1068 = ~Salve, miei buon amici, e benv... Stivan! E' da un pezzo che non ti vedevo! Mi stavo proprio chiedendo che fine avessi fatto.~
@1069 = ~Ehilà, Samuel! Scusami se non passo a salutarti con la stessa frequenza di prima, ma adesso viaggio con una compagnia di avventurieri e siamo sempre impegnati in qualche impresa eroica da una parte o dall'altra.~
@1070 = ~Oho! Questa è una buona notizia! Finalmente Tymora ti sorride!~
@1071 = ~Ti avrei fatto dono degli stivali che indossavo ai tempi in cui erravo lungo la Costa della Spada, ma li ho già dati alla dolce Mazzy.~
@1072 = ~Mi raccomando, tratta bene la mia paladina preferita.~
@1073 = ~*Ahem* Certo, Samuel. Lei ed io andiamo d'amore e d'accordo.~
@1074 = ~Uhmm... C'è forse del tenero tra voi due?~
@1075 = ~Tra me e la venditrice di patate? Sei forse impazzito?~
@1076 = ~Se ti sentisse chiamarla in questo modo, Stivan, credo che te la vedresti brutta.~
@1077 = ~Heh. Cercherò di trattenermi, allora.~
@1078 = ~Se aspetti qualche istante, ho una sorpresa per te. Non scappare via!~
@1079 = ~Se le cose stanno così, lasciami recuperare gli stivali che indossavo quando erravo lungo la Costa della Spada. Serviranno più a te che a me. Dunque, dove li ho messi...? Ah, eccoli qui. Tieni. Spero che ti vadano bene.~
@1080 = ~Wow! Grazie, Samuel. Sei veramente gentile.~
@1081 = ~Ehi, mi calzano alla perfezione!~
@1082 = ~Non avevo dubbi. Se aspetti qualche istante, ho un'altra sorpresa per te. Non scappare via!~
@1083 = ~D'accordo, ti aspettiamo.~
@1084 = ~Hai visto quant'è gentile, <CHARNAME>? Mi ha aiutato molto dopo la morte dei miei genitori e dei miei fratelli.~
@1085 = ~L'alta considerazione che hai di lui è palese.~
@1086 = ~Avevo sentito dire che tra gli halfling c'è grande solidarietà, e ne ho appena avuto conferma.~
@1087 = ~Che sorpresa pensi abbia in mente?~
@1088 = ~In che modo ti ha aiutato?~
@1089 = ~Boh. Non ci resta che aspettare e vedere.~
@1090 = ~Questo caro amico di famiglia fu il solo ad offirmi una spalla su cui appoggiarmi dopo che quel bruttone di Saerk ebbe commesso le schifezze che ti ho già raccontato.~
@1091 = ~Quando i miei genitori e i miei fratelli vennero uccisi dai gabbiani, chiesi subito aiuto al socio in affari di mio padre. Non avevo la benchè minima idea di come gestire la mia eredità, ma pensavo che lui più di tutti mi avrebbe potuto dare una mano.~
@1092 = ~Samuel mi offrì alloggio qui, alla Locanda dei Cinque Boccali, ma quando iniziai la mia giusta campagna contro i gabbiani dovetti andarmene. Pare che alcuni clienti non ne apprezzassero la visione, ed io non volevo certo rovinargli gli affari, soprattutto dopo tutto quello che aveva fatto per me.~
@1093 = ~Questo spiega tutto. Si vede che è una brava persona.~
@1094 = ~Sarebbe stato più saggio rivolgersi a lui anzichè al socio di tuo padre, non credi?~
@1095 = ~Non avresti potuto smettere di ammazzare quei poveri uccelli? Almeno in questo modo avresti avuto un tetto sotto la testa.~
@1096 = ~(Snort!) E' facile giudicare a posteriori, <CHARNAME>! Non c'era nulla che mi inducesse a pensare che sarebbe successo quello che è successo!~
@1097 = ~Heh. Ti adoro quando fai lo spiritoso.~
@1098 = ~Eccomi di ritorno - scusatemi per avervi fatto attendere!~
@1099 = ~Ma quello... Quello è...~
@1100 = ~Sì! E' uno degli ultimi fiaschi di vino prodotto dalla tua famiglia. Li conservo come se fossero i più preziosi tra i tesori, ma direi che è il caso di gustarne uno per festeggiare la tua nuova vita da avventuriero!~
@1101 = ~(Sniff) Grazie, Samuel. Sono commosso...~
@1102 = ~Oh, non piangere. Sarebbe un peccato se le tue lacrime salate finissero in un buon bicchiere di vino. Ecco, prendete; uno per te, ed uno per il tuo amico.~
@1103 = ~Coraggio, <CHARNAME>, bevine un sorso. Sono sicuro che ti piacerà!~
@1104 = ~Er... Veramente sono astemio...~
@1105 = ~Ti ringrazio, ma il vino proprio non mi piace.~
@1106 = ~Io adoro il vino, soprattutto quello rosso. Stivan, Samuel, alla salute!~
@1107 = ~Davvero? Che peccato. Allora brinderemo solo Samuel ed io. Alla salute, amico!~
@1108 = ~Alla salute!~
@1109 = ~Semplicemente divino!~
@1110 = ~Samuel, vuoi darti una mossa o no?! Per quale motivo te ne stai lì a chiacchierare quando io mi ammazzo di lavoro tra un tavolo e l'altro?~
@1111 = ~Er... Il dovere mi chiama, amici. Adesso devo proprio lasciarvi, ma tornate a trovarmi presto!~
@1112 = ~Puoi contarci, Samuel! Grazie di tutto e stammi bene!~
@1113 = ~... Grazie anche a te, <CHARNAME>. Questa sosta mi ha decisamente ringalluzzito, e ora mi sento pronto a tornare all'avventura con le gote belle rosse. Heh.~
@1114 = ~Sai, <CHARNAME>, sono veramente contento che tu mi abbia chiesto di viaggiare al tuo fianco. Grazie a te non soffro più la fame e potrò dare ai miei familiari un luogo in cui riposare indisturbati. Non mi sentivo così carico da anni, ormai!~
@1115 = ~Sei sempre stato povero, Stivan?~
@1116 = ~Eppure mi sembrava che ti piacesse vendere piume.~
@1117 = ~Mi fa piacere saperlo. La tua conoscenza della città si è rivelata estremamente utile.~
@1118 = ~Ottimo. Continuiamo il nostro cammino ben determinati, allora.~
@1119 = ~Oh no. Un tempo vivevo in condizioni di gran lunga migliori!~
@1120 = ~*Ahem* Vendere piume era un espediente di cui mi servivo per sopravvivere. Preferivo di gran lunga le occupazioni di un tempo.~
@1121 = ~Heh. La mia conoscenza non si limita alla capitale di Amn, sai? Sono stato in molti altri posti, e adesso ti spiego come e perché.~
@1122 = ~Yeah! Andiamo!~
@1123 = ~Ah, un’ultima cosa. Quando vuoi fare una sosta, potremmo andare alla Locanda dei Cinque Boccali nel Quartiere del Ponte a bere un buon bicchiere di vino. Il proprietario è un halfling come me, anche se io sono molto più simpatico. Heh.~
@1124 = ~La mia famiglia gestiva dei vigneti poco fuori Athkatla che venivano tramandati da generazioni. Tutti gli aspetti legati alla coltivazione venivano curati da un socio di mio papà, mentre noi ci occupavamo della vendita del prodotto finale: un vino semplicemente fenomenale!~
@1125 = ~Ogni anno, dopo la stagione della vendemmia, i miei fratelli ed io partivamo insieme a papino per vendere le nostre botti, mentre la mamma restava a casa per commerciarne una piccola parte con i mercanti locali. Al nostro ritorno, dividevamo le entrate con i Farrahd.~
@1126 = ~Quindi hai una certa conoscenza in materia di vini, giusto?~
@1127 = ~Percorrevate sempre le stesse rotte o cambiavate percorso di anno in anno?~
@1128 = ~Non ho capito se abitavate in campagna o in città.~
@1129 = ~E’ stato molto interessante ascoltarti. Adesso però dobbiamo ritornare alle nostre occupazioni.~
@1130 = ~Esatto. Tutto merito di papà!~
@1131 = ~Un po’ e un po’. I posti dove la vendita era particolarmente proficua costituivano una tappa fissa; quelli che invece non avevano fruttato un granchè li scartavamo a favore di altri in cui non eravamo mai andati.~
@1132 = ~Abitavamo in città, in una casetta nel Quartiere del Ponte. In campagna invece c’era una grande fattoria dove vivevano i braccianti che lavoravano per noi.~
@1133 = ~La nostra vita era scandita da un calendario di eventi che mi hanno sempre rassicurato. Tutto si ripeteva secondo una certa ciclicità... Almeno sino a quando non vennero i gabbiani.~
@1134 = ~(Snort!) Maledetti uccellacci! Mi sale la bile al sol pronunciare il loro nome! Porto ancora oggi i segni di quell’incontro!~
@1135 = ~A giudicare dalle tue cicatrici, anche tu devi aver avuto qualche esperienza turbolenta in passato. Sei forse stato assalito da uno stormo di gabbiani?~
@1136 = ~Queste? Sono il frutto delle torture di Irenicus, il mago che stiamo cercando.~
@1137 = ~Dunque, vediamo... Questa mi è stata inferta da un coboldo nelle miniere di Nashkel, mentre questa l’ho riportata nella battaglia contro Sarevok a Baldur’s Gate. Oh, dimenticavo *questa*: un regalo di Irenicus, il mago che mi ha catturato e torturato.~
@1138 = ~Nessun incontro ravvicinato con i gabbiani, per fortuna. Queste sono semplicemente i segni delle ferite riportate nelle ultime battaglie. Le vere cicatrici sono quelle che Irenicus ha inferto al mio animo torturandomi.~
@1139 = ~Non cambiare discorso, Stivan. Cosa successe?~
@1140 = ~Com’è possibile che dei gabbiani abbiano aggredito la tua famiglia? Non è nella loro natura essere così aggressivi.~
@1141 = ~(Stivan estrae l’urna con le ceneri dei suoi familiari dallo zaino). Successe *questo*.~
@1142 = ~Stavo dicendo: come ti sei procurato quelle cicatrici? Sono forse opera di gabbiani?~
@1143 = ~Poco importa quale sia la loro natura, il risultato è sempre lo stesso!~
@1144 = ~Se l’occhio non mi inganna, le tue cicatrici sembrerebbero proprio opera di gabbiani. Non è forse così?~
@1145 = ~Ti ha torturato? E perché mai?~
@1146 = ~Essere un figlio di Bhaal comporta questo e ben altro.~
@1147 = ~E’ quello che sto cercando di scoprire. Imoen, la ragazza che è stata imprigionata con me, mi ha detto che voleva esplorare il mio potenziale di figlio di Bhaal, anche se non ho idea di cosa questo significhi.~
@1148 = ~Cosa?! Stai scherzando, vero? Mia mamma diceva sempre che le signorine non si toccano neanche con un fiore!~
@1149 = ~E’ quello che dico anch’io.~
@1150 = ~Temo che i genitori di Irenicus non abbiano fatto altrettanto.~
@1151 = ~Er... Non credo che Irenicus conosca la cavalleria...~
@1152 = ~Hai idea del perché ti abbia torturata?~
@1153 = ~Essere una figlia di Bhaal comporta questo e ben altro.~
@1154 = ~E’ quello che sto cercando di scoprire. Imoen, la ragazza che è stata imprigionata con me, mi ha detto che voleva esplorare il mio potenziale di figlia di Bhaal, anche se non ho idea di cosa questo significhi.~
@1155 = ~Bhaal? Ho già sentito questo nome...~
@1156 = ~Ma certo! E’ quel dongiovanni che durante il Periodo dei Disordini seduceva tutte le donne che incontrava sulla sua strada, giusto?~
@1157 = ~Come fai a conoscere quel periodo?~
@1158 = ~Er... Non proprio. Bhaal era una divinità malvagia che, conscia della sua futura caduta, ha lasciato una prole che sperava alimentasse la sua rinascita.~
@1159 = ~Io lo chiamerei “Bhaal: dongiovanni nel tempo libero, Signore dell’Omicidio di professione”.~
@1160 = ~*Ahem* Dall’aspetto non si direbbe, ma io sono più grande di te, sai?~
@1161 = ~Ricordo quegli anni. Papà era preoccupatissimo a causa della scomparsa di Waukeen, la dea del commercio. Temeva che gli affari ne avrebbero risentito, e in effetti per un po’ di tempo fu così.~
@1162 = ~Questo significa che non tu sei un comune <RACE> come gli altri! Vali qualcosa, sotto sotto!~
@1163 = ~E cosa mi dici di tua madre?~
@1164 = ~Non l’ho mai conosciuta. Non so nulla di lei. Né il nome, né l’aspetto... Nulla.~
@1165 = ~Non ho idea di chi sia. Gorion, il mio patrigno, ha sempre evitato l’argomento.~
@1166 = ~Merita solo il mio più profondo disprezzo. Mi ha abbandonato dopo avermi dato alla luce.~
@1167 = ~Accidenti. La storia della tua vita è più complicata delle trame degli spettacoli che danno alla Locanda dei Cinque Boccali. Ci sei mai stato? E’ nel Quartiere del Ponte. Magari lì potremmo continuare a parlare davanti a un buon bicchiere di vino. Il proprietario è un halfling come me, anche se io sono molto più simpatico. Heh.~
@1168 = ~Mi hai parlato di una missione quando ci siamo incontrati per la prima volta, <CHARNAME>, e non posso fare a meno di chiedermi se abbiamo fatto dei progressi ultimamente.~
@1169 = ~Più o meno.~
@1170 = ~Non quanti vorrei. Ora come ora, sto raccogliendo una certa somma di denaro per Gaelan Bayle, il rappresentante di un'organizzazione che mi ha offerto il suo aiuto.~
@1171 = ~Ho due contatti che potrebbero fare al caso mio. Gaelan Bayle, un uomo che ho incontrato poco dopo il mio arrivo ad Athkatla, e una certa "Signora" di cui devo ancora valutare l'offerta.~
@1172 = ~Dubito che andremo avanti se mi interrompi in continuazione. Un pò di silenzio, per favore.~
@1173 = ~Più o meno, eh? D'accordo, vediamo se mi viene in mente qualcuno che possa esserti d'aiuto...~
@1174 = ~Uhmm... Il clero qui in città è molto ricco e potente, ma dubito che i suoi membri si esporrebbero così tanto per uno sconosciuto. Sono troppo impegnati a genuflettersi davanti alle statue dei loro dei e cose simili.~
@1175 = ~Lo stesso dicasi per il Cuore Radioso: a meno che tu non prometta loro una "campagna contro il male" o qualche altra sciocchezza con cui si riempiono la bocca, continueranno a fare gli sbruffoni e a lucidare le loro armature.~
@1176 = ~Altri?~
@1177 = ~Oltre a questi... Non mi vengono in mente altri gruppi abbastanza potenti da prendere per il naso gli Incappucciati. Del resto, stiamo parlando di un'organizzazione potente. Cosa sai di loro?~
@1178 = ~Nulla, in realtà. Lungo la Costa della Spada non sono noti.~
@1179 = ~Sino ad ora ho raccolto veramente poche informazioni. Non riesco a capire se la gente non parli per paura o per semplice ignoranza.~
@1180 = ~So che *non* sono collaborativi. Il loro rappresentante al Palazzo di Giustizia non scuce una sola parola.~
@1181 = ~Anch'io ignoro i dettagli di cui hai bisogno, <CHARNAME>. Qui ad Athkatla si sa poco o nulla degli Incappucciati: sembra quasi che esistano da sempre, ma le cose non stanno così.~
@1182 = ~La mia famiglia abita nella capitale dell'Amn da molte generazioni, pertanto la storia della comparsa di quei maghetti nella nostra città è stata tramandata sino a me e ai miei fratelli.~
@1183 = ~Tuttavia, mentre la maggior parte dei racconti si arricchisce di dettagli col passare di bocca in bocca, questo si è gradualmente impoverito.~
@1184 = ~Stando a quello che mi hanno raccontato i miei genitori, l'enclave degli Stregoni Incappucciati venne fondata circa due secoli fa da un tale di Esmeltaran allo scopo di proteggere la tradizione magica nell'Amn e fermare coloro che avessero abusato della Trama per fare i cattivoni.~
@1185 = ~Nessuno sa chi siano veramente quei maghi, quale sia la loro base e come facciano a trovare immediatamente chiunque utilizzi la magia. Soprattutto, resta un mistero perchè all'improvviso siano diventati così... spregiudicati.~
@1186 = ~Quindi hanno perso il lume della ragione soltanto di recente? Bizzarro. Avrei scommesso che fossero stati fuori di testa sin dalle origini.~
@1187 = ~Sembrerebbe la tipica degenerazione di quanti accumulano troppo potere senza avere la capacità di gestirlo.~
@1188 = ~In effetti il loro operato sarebbe valido e sensato se agissero con più criterio.~
@1189 = ~Il loro atteggiamento è cambiato drasticamente un anno prima della scomparsa dei miei familiari. Vi fu un colpo di stato... Un Incappucciato cercò di prendere il controllo del Consiglio, ma venne scoperto e fatto fuori.~
@1190 = ~Non ricordo altro. Non avevo che uno spruzzo di peli sui piedi e, come forse ti ho già detto, non ho una buona memoria.~
@1191 = ~Cerchiamo di guardare il lato positivo delle cose. Se non ci fossero stati gli Incappucciati, tu ed io non ci saremmo mai incontrati!~
@1192 = ~A cosa segue cosa, giusto. Immagino sia una considerazione a cui debba abituarmi, soprattutto a causa del mio lignaggio.~
@1193 = ~Senza offesa, Stivan, ma avrei fatto volentieri a meno della tua conoscenza se questo avesse significato non perdere Imoen.~
@1194 = ~Non sempre mi riesce di vedere l'altro lato della medaglia, specialmente ora che mi trovo in questa situazione.~
@1195 = ~... Se questa era una battuta, <CHARNAME>, sappi che era tutto fuorchè simpatica.~
@1196 = ~Mia mamma diceva sempre che ciò che dobbiamo imparare a fare lo impariamo facendolo. Gli anni che ho trascorso in strada le hanno dato ragione. Del resto, non si sbagliava mai.~
@1197 = ~In... in che razza di posto ci hai condotti, <CHARNAME>?~
@1198 = ~Da quando siamo qui abbiamo dovuto combattere beholder, mind flayer, e ora demoni! Cos'altro ci aspetta, un drago? Un'esercito di drow?~
@1199 = ~Uhm, presenti esclusi, ovviamente!~
@1200 = ~Hmpf. Sarei tentata di tradirvi e unirmi alla prima pattuglia drow che incontro pur di poterti zittire una volta per sempre, jaluk.~
@1201 = ~Heh. Ti adoro quando hai voglia di scherzare, Viccy!~
@1202 = ~Non mettere a prova la tua buona sorte, piccoletto.~
@1203 = ~Non ho mica scelto io questo luogo! La colpa è di Saemon Havarian!~
@1204 = ~Coraggio. Ho la sensazione che presto saremo di ritorno ad Athkatla.~
@1205 = ~Tu hai paura? A me piace qua. Tre anni di battaglie, e del male non ci sarà altro che il ricordo!~
@1206 = ~Si vede che sei un buon capo - sei sempre svelto a scaricare le colpe sugli altri!~
@1207 = ~Veramente...~
@1208 = ~Guarda che...~
@1209 = ~Di cosa stai...~
@1210 = ~Speriamo...~
@1211 = ~Co-cosa? Tu sei matto!~
@1212 = ~Ooh, sai anche negare l'evidenza - sei proprio tagliato per comandare!~
@1213 = ~Mi raccomando, quando ti eleggono come Consigliere dell'Amn, nomina me come ministro della difesa aerea!~
@1214 = ~Mi sembri a tuo agio in questo posto, Jaheira, come se ti trovassi a casa.~
@1215 = ~In un certo senso lo sono. Ho visto la luce proprio in questa nazione, sebbene in una regione molto più a sud rispetto a dove ci troviamo.~
@1216 = ~Se hai intenzione di farci un salto, ti accompagnerei volentieri. Le strade maestre di questa regione si snodano lungo una catena di piccoli villaggi halfling noti per la qualità del loro artigianato. Mio papà aveva molto a cuore quei posti.~
@1217 = ~L'ora della vendetta non può più essere rimandata, pertanto valuterò questa possibilità in un secondo momento. Ad ogni modo, sarebbe una tappa intermedia di un viaggio molto più lungo.~
@1218 = ~Per dirigerti dove?~
@1219 = ~Penso sia mio dovere andare a Calimshan. Io... Non vorrei, ma sento che è la cosa giusta da fare.~
@1220 = ~A prescindere dalle motivazioni che ti spingono a compiere questo viaggio, ti consiglio di non andarci da sola. Non avevo nessuno al mio fianco quando sono andato a rivedere i vigneti che un tempo appartenevano alla mia famiglia, e ti assicuro che non è stata un'esperienza piacevole.~
@1221 = ~Suppongo sia dipeso dallo spirito con cui vi sei tornato.~
@1222 = ~Era inevitabile che nutrissi alcune aspettative: che quella fattoria, quel sentiero, quegli intrecci di foglie, una volta rivisti, mi ispirassero un particolare sentimento, ma sono rimasto meravigliato quando la sola cosa che ho provato è stata un’improvvisa stilettata di memoria provocata da scenari e ambienti ai quali non avrei mai attribuito un tale potere di ferire.~
@1223 = ~Il luogo in cui vorrei andare ha delle associazioni dolorose, ma farò il possibile perché mi lasci indifferente. Ho intenzione di percorrerlo in lungo e in largo, sbarazzina e risoluta, per poi andarmene non appena avrò ottemperato certe... formalità.~
@1224 = ~Ebbene, direi che abbiamo indugiato abbastanza. Questa conversazione mi ha dato diversi spunti su cui riflettere, e sono piacevolmente sorpresa dalla profondità di quanto hai detto.~
@1225 = ~Heh. L'ho sempre detto che sono sottovalutato.~
@1226 = ~Seguimi, maschio. Appagherai i miei desideri sino a quando ne avrò voglia!~
@1227 = ~(Arrossisce) Mia mamma diceva sempre che certe cose si fanno solo da sposati...~
@1228 = ~Cosa diavolo stai blaterando?~
@1229 = ~Lui appartiene a me, femmina. Fatti da parte, o assaggerai la mia ira.~
@1230 = ~Perdonami, sorella. Non sapevo fosse di tua proprietà.~
@1231 = ~... Quella donna voleva appropriarsi della mia innocenza!~
@1232 = ~E' proprio per questo che sono intervenuta. *LE* ho risparmiato un fato invero terribile.~
@1233 = ~Abbassa il tuo sguardo al mio cospetto, maschio!~
@1234 = ~Se abbasso la testa, come faccio a vedere dove vado?~
@1235 = ~Osi contraddirmi?! Le Ancelle della Regina dei Ragni ti strapperanno il cuore per questo affronto!~
@1236 = ~Non c'è bisogno di scomodarle. Punirò io questo insolente.~
@1237 = ~Lascio a te il piacere, femmina. Possano i tentacoli della tua verga affondare nella carne di quel verme!~
@1238 = ~... Me la sono vista brutta. Grazie, Jaheira.~
@1239 = ~Presta attenzione a ciò che dici e a come ti comporti, Stivan. In futuro potrei non riuscire ad aiutarti.~
@1240 = ~Tu, laggiù. Sembri dotato, per essere un maschio di Ched Nasad. Avanti, seguimi nei miei alloggi.~
@1241 = ~Io, ah... Devo svolgere dei compiti per la Matrona. Compiti di fondamentale importanza.~
@1242 = ~Non abusare della mia pazienza, miserabile! Ti aspetterò presso la Società delle Femmine Guerriere, e farai bene a non tardare!~
@1243 = ~Sì, mia signora. Sarò da voi... non appena possibile.~
@1244 = ~Cos... Chi ha osato lanciarmi in faccia una simile schifezza? Chi?! Se trovo il responsabile di questo affronto lo getterò nella Fossa dei Ragni!~
@1245 = ~Heh. La cacca di gabbiano non perdona.~
@1246 = ~Per Yondalla! Cosa ci fa un mezzopelo in un quartiere pericoloso come i Bassifondi?~
@1247 = ~Questa zona è una delle più pericolose della città, è vero, ma ti assicuro che so badare a me stesso.~
@1248 = ~Ehi! Dov’è finita la mia pagnotta?!~
@1249 = ~(Gnamm!) Non... Non ho visto nulla!~
@1250 = ~Ciao, piccolino. Mi venderesti qualche piuma?~
@1251 = ~Certo, Rose. Il solito?~
@1252 = ~Questa volta facciamo solo cinque. Purtroppo ho perso alcuni dei clienti che impazzivano quando le usavo per certi giochetti erotici.~
@1253 = ~(Arrossisce) Non... Non voglio sapere altro. Ecco, a te.~
@1254 = ~Sei proprio delizioso quando arrossisci in quel modo. Ci vediamo, tesoruccio.~
@1255 = ~Uhmmm... Il tuo sguattero sembra decisamente ossequioso, Nalia. Sei disposta a vendermelo?~
@1256 = ~Non so a chi vi stiate riferendo, Lord Ophal. Non ho bisogno di viaggiare con la servitù di casa.~
@1257 = ~Stai dicendo che quella creatura non è alle tue dipendenze?~
@1258 = ~Stivan il Cacciatore esegue ogni desiderio di Miss Nalia!~
@1259 = ~E' addirittura capace di parlare. Sono pronto a farti un'ottima offerta, mia diletta. Dieci monete d'oro vanno bene?~
@1260 = ~Wow! Non pensavo di valere così tanto!~
@1261 = ~Vi suggerisco di andarvene, Lord Ophal. Non mi interessa il vostro sporco denaro, e non tratto le persone come bestiame destinato alla vendita.~
@1262 = ~Che peccato. Sarebbe stato un ottimo affare.~
@1263 = ~Nalia... Nel mio circolo si vocifera da tempo che fossi decaduta, ma i pettegolezzi non rendono l'idea della tua miseria.~
@1264 = ~Siete tale e uguale a vostra figlia, Miss Tandolan, se non peggio. Ad ogni modo, non mi interessa ciò che dite su di me nei vostri salotti.~
@1265 = ~Ma certo, cara. Tornatene tra gli zingari a cui ormai appartieni.~
@1266 = ~La vera nobiltà non deriva dalla nascita, ma dalle proprie azioni. Il massimo a cui potete aspirare è il titolo di bruttona tra le bruttone, sapete?~
@1267 = ~Come osi, mostriciattolo! Potrei farti arrestare dalle mie guardie per una simile infamia!~
@1268 = ~Quali guardie? Quelle che i Ladri Tenebrosi si vantano di aver raggirato un'infinità di volte?~
@1269 = ~Non... Non finisce qui! Vi siete appena fatti una nemica!~
@1270 = ~... Ti ringrazio, Stivan. Sei stato molto gentile.~
@1271 = ~Heh. Non potevo fare diversamente. Questa era una delle volte in cui tacere diventa una colpa e parlare diventa un obbligo.~
