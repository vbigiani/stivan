To make the blade deadlier, the smith Cromwell strenghtnened its enchantment and embued the weapon with the properties of the item Stivan would never part with - seagull poo. Strangely, Stivan refrained from telling Cromwell the nature of that "strange whitish goo".

// TODO
@89   = ~There was a time when Tyr wasn't known as ''. The greatest of the Triad's deities, in fact, lost his right hand in his battle against Kezef the Chaos'Hound, but before that thime he used to pair his lethal weapon with this shield. Legend says that Tyr still wielded this until the Time of Disorders, when he donated it to his Cormyrian followers for having remained loyal to him after being blinded by Lord Ao.
Sebbene sia sempre stato custodito dai paladini e dai chierici devoti al dio, lo scudo in questione viene utilizzato ogni anno in occasione di un rito propiziatorio al raccolto e alla lustrazione dei campi. Il culto di Tyr è infatti molto diffuso nelle campagne, dove viene chiamato dai più "Dio Pannocchia".

Forged in heavy steel with silver accentures, the artifact is so heavy it is more a burden than a protection in battle. It appears that, until now, only Tyr had been able to wield it, to the point it takes more than a person to transport it.
