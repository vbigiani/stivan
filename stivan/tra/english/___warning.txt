Thank you for considering to translate Stivan!

The mod was initially written in Italian and only subsequently translated to
English. Inevitably, some subtle meanings, word plays, or plain jokes were
lost. As such, while you can freely translate the mod from English if you wish
to do so, you should consider translating it from Italian instead, to ensure
a better quality for your translation.
