<br>Stivan was an halfling in the Docks, obsessed with seagulls. To find him, open the map and look for the red note.
<br>Now he is joinable. He is a Chaotic Neutral FT halfling (my favourite class) with good but not godly stats, thief skills are set according to my playstyle, which includes Ease of Use - no traps or locks :) . If you haven't that mod installed, you can use him in conjunction with Yoshimo-Immy combo.
<br>He has a script of his own. You might want to turn it off is you are using some third-party script (eSeries, uScript...). To change your setting, force-talk Stivan.
<br>If attacked while out of the party, Stivan will defend himself. I upgraded the scripts USEITEM.BCS and YOSHX.bcs for him to use.
<br>The portait was done by ArchMage Silver, Galactycon helped with adding a circle to seagulls, and finally <u><span style='color:blue'>&lt;insert_name_here&gt;</u></span> did the voicing
<br>
<br>Stats (I've hidden these since you may not care about these):
<table style="FILTER: Glow(Color=beige, Strength='.(('2'<400)?'2':400).')" width=.(( 300?<400)??300?:400).?\><FONT  color=beige>
Strenght 12
<br>Dexterity 18 (+1 from original .cre)
<br>Constitution 16 (+2 from original .cre)
<br>Intelligence 8
<br>Wisdom 10
<br>Charisma 8
<br>Experience: 161000 (Fighter 7 Thief 8)
<br>
<br>Thieving skills:
<br>Pick Pockets 30
<br>Open Locks 30
<br>Find/Remove Traps 15
<br>Move Silently 35
<br>Hide in Shadows 120
<br>Detect Illusions 30
<br>Set Traps 100
</font><tbody></tbody></table><br>
<br>Script features:
<br> - Auto-attacks seagulls.  &lt;-- Doesn't work
<br> - Auto-hide.
<br> - Auto-find traps (note though that he doesn't have a single point in the skill when you pick him up) and Detects Illusions as needed.
<br> - Uses potions of invisibility, healing and Greater Healing when hurt (50%).
<br> - Auto-backstabs nearest enemy, then continue attacking. Improved targeting is used down here.
<br>Note that these options can be turned off one-per-one as needed, simply force-talk Stivan.
<br>
<br>Force-talk features:
<br> - Modify Stivan's script (see above).
<br> - Auto-sets traps. You choose the number, and he uses wizard_improved_alucrity to speed up things. Then, he talks again to you, so that you can reset his script (I need to block it all in order to prevent unwanted problems)
<br> - Auto-fix script. Use it in case he changes his name to something strange, or says weird things when selected/given orders, or whatever. This often occurs if you have him in the party and then re-install some mods.  &lt;-- Doesn't work
<br>
<br>Gameplay notes (possible spoilers):
<br><table style="FILTER: Glow(Color=beige, Strength='.(('2'<400)?'2':400).')" width=.(( 300?<400)??300?:400).?\><FONT  color=beige>
He may have conflicts with other NPCs (Jaheira). You can cool him off always, though.
<br>There are different routes to take, depending on how you direct the dialogues. He will receive different quests, dialogues and epilogue.

<a name="install"><font size=+3><b> 2. Installation and uninstallation</b><br></font>
<p>It's <b>not</b> the same as most WeiDU mods, since you have to check some stuff manually!
<br>You should obtain and install the latest SOA or TOB patch from <a href="http://www.interplay.com">Interplay</a> or <a href=http://www.bioware.com>Bioware</a> BEFORE installing any of these components.
<br>After that, get the last Baldurash post-patch Fix Pack from <a href="http://www.baldurdash.org" Target=_blank>Baldurdash</a>
<BR><BR>Do I really need to explain how WeiDU works? I hope not ;-)

<a name="bugs"><font size=+3><b>3. Known bugs and incompatibility problems</b></font>
<p><font size=+2>(In)Compatibility:</font><br>
<br><font size=+1><i>Stivan</i></font>
<br>Some scripts in the mod require that Detectable Spells is installed in order to work properly. You can get somewhat near here <a href=http://home.earthlink.net/~cirerrek/>Cirrerek's main page</a>. The mod will install properly also without it, but it won't run at 100%. Please also note that many mods (to name a few: Ascension, Kelsey, Kiara/Zayia, Spell 50, Oversight - Tougher Sendai) already provide Detectable spells, so 90% of the times this won't be a major problem.
<br>Alas, this would mean that the Stupid Script of Dissaster (you know what I mean, eheheh) won't run properly. Another good reason to uninstall it.
<br><br>
<font size=+2>Known Bugs or other in-game problems:</font><br>
<br><font size=+1><i>Stivan</i></font>
<br>Note: I solved by removing this part --> Seagull's animation now looks really weird. I had to do this in order to give them a foot circle. Sorry if you don't like it now...
<br><br>If you smell something wrong with another mod, post at <a href=http://forums.forgottenwars.net/index.php?showforum=167>my forum</a>, and I will do anything possible to fix it, or will warn people in the readme.<br>

<a name="thankyou"><font size=+3><b>4. Thank you</b></font><br>
DEVELOPER:
<br>Valerio Bigiani (The Bigg)
<br>
<br>MISC THANKS:
<br>
<br>-   Weimer, for explaining me the whole ~"% thing in WeiDU. Alas… Had I learned it the day before, I wouldn't have changed manually all the " in the 20 pages of .d in alt+0126 (a.k.a. ~). Oh yes, nearly forgetting: WeiDU was necessary to do this MOD; in particular I want to thank him for the STR_CMP function. I originally asked it for the Refinements, but it's proving even more useful than I believed (at least to me).
<br>-   T.G.Maestro, for indirectly having hinted to me that I could be a decent MODder, and for lending me a file for the sake of the Mprolla component.
<br>-   A certain "Gulliard" for providing false identity to Mprilla at my forums, and bringing some useless spam to it.
<br>-   Icelus, for kindly hosting my mod.
<br>-   TheWizard, for additional hosting.
<br>-   Archmage Silver had created the portrait of Stivan.
<br>-   Cirrerek, who allowed me to insert portions of Detectable & Scriptable Spells, for optimal work and scripting.
<br><br> Joe B, for being the first person to report a bug ;)
<br><br> Ohter people who reported bugs by e-mail, so I'm not sure about the nicknames:
<br>-   Mathias Jakobsen
<br>
<br>IDEAS BLATANTLY STOLEN:
<br>Stivan (as I noted above) is a scenery NPC in original BG2.
<br>
<br>DEDICATED TO:
<br><font size=+5><b><u>This Mod is dedicated to the memory of Luca Poli</u></font></b>, a schoolmate and big friend of mine who had committed suicide on February 2004, the 13th.
<br><font size=+5><u>You never died really in my heart.</u></font><br><br>
<font size=-1> (Some dialogues in the mod are directly inspired to him, namely the "sad story" of the lich dialogue). To see this dialogue, select, during the first talk with the lich, 3, 2, 1 and 1.</font>

<a name="links"><font size=+3><b>5. Links.</b></font>
<p><a href=mailto:Wal.big.it@libero.it target=_blank>My e-mail</a>. If you post a bug and/or incompatibility problem, tell me the version you're using and send these two files: setup-mazzythepaladin.debug and weidu.log (they both are in your main BG2 directory).
<br><a href=http://www.forgottenwars.net target=_blank>Forgotten Wars</a>, home of this mod and other fine projects; in particular, <a href=http://forums.forgottenwars.net/index.php?showforum=167 target=_blank>My forum</a>.
<br><a href=http://www.weidu.org target=_blank>WeiDU</a>, home of, guess, Weimer Dialogue Utility and some of the finer mods.
<br><a href=http://www.teambg.com target=_black>TeamBG</a>, from where you can download most MODding tools. I strongly reccomend DLTCEP (which requires you to DL also IEEP). I've also used CREmaker and IETME in some steps. Oh yes: download from there also the whole IESDP, it's worth it!
<br><a href=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~joh/ni/ target=_blank>Near Infinity</a>, a really professional and powerful editing tool for Infinity Engine modding (complements with DLTCEP, since DLTCEP is easier to understand, while NI is more professional).
<br><a href=http://www.fixedsys.com/context target=_blank>ConTEXT</a>: a text editor designed to write code. See WeiDU main page for optimisation for .baf, .d and .tp2 in ConTEXT. Definitely use this if you are writing anything in code, not only BG2 MODs (but that's old news, of course:-) )

<br><a href=http://www.gibberlings3.net target=_blank>The Gibberlings 3</a>. Another modding group, th g3pack contains also the HP fixes I planned for the tb#pack. Since they have released it before me, I bowed down and let them keep the reservation (their code cannot be easily made compatible with mine).
