					Introduction

				<p>
					This mod adds Stivan the Hunter, a new joinable NPC, to Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn
          and its expansion, Throne of Bhaal, complete with the usual array of banters, friendships,
          quests and interjections.

          About Stivan
        </h4>
      <p>
          Stivan is a Chaotic Neutral Male Halfling Fighter/Thief whom you can find in the Bridge District (a map
          marker is added to help you find him) and will join any party.
          <br><br>Portraits:
          <table border="1"><tr>
          <td><img src="portraits/nix_scars/tb%23stivl.bmp" alt="Stivan Portrait" width="210" height="330" align="left" /></td>

          <p>Biography</p>
            <div class="divimp">
          If asked about his past, STIVAN doesn't wait before narrating his life in detail. Born in Athkatla
          to a family of wine merchants, the Halfling saw his parents being slaughtered by a ravaging flock of seagulls,
          an attack he survived by sheer luck. Thus his hatred for what he defines "the feathered enemy", which he claims
          to be responsible of his next misfortunes as well - losing his father's activity and possessions to a rich
          merchant who, rather than help him, left him penniless.
          <br>Forced to live on Athkatla's streets, the Halfling happily accepted CHARNAME's offer to join his band,
          glad to offer him his knowledge of the city and thankful for having found a new ally on his crusade against seagulls.
          </div>
          <p><br>
          <br>Gameplay information</p>
          <div class="divimp">
          To allow you to better fine-tune his weapon proficiencies and thievery skills, Stivan will join as a first level
          Fighter/Thief with 161.000 XP, enough to become a 7/8 Fighter/Thief straight away.
          <br><br>Stats:
          <ul><li>STR 14</li>
          <li>DEX 19</li>
          <li>CON 16</li>
          <li>INT 13</li>
          <li>WIS 8</li>
          <li>CHR 10</li></ul>
          <br>Initial thief skills (base + spent = total):
          <ul><li>Open Locks 35 + 0 = 35</li>
          <li>Find Traps 20 + 0 = 20</li>
          <li>Pick pockets 35 + 15 = 50</li>
          <li>Move Silently 40 + 15 = 55</li>
          <li>Hide in Shadows 35 + 10 = 45</li>
          <li>Detect Illusions 0 + 0 = 0</li>
          <li>Set Traps 10 + 0 = 10</li>
          </ul>
          <br>Initial weapon proficiency are:
          <ul><li>** Short Sword</li>
          <li>** Sling</li></ul>
          </div>
          
          <p><br><br><br><br>The rest of this section will contain minor spoilers about BG2 and the Stivan
          mod itself, so don't read if you want to be surprised. Bigger spoilers will be hidden and must be
          selected to be read, like this: <span class="midspoiler">The big bad is Irenicus!</span>. The really surprising
          spoilers are  hidden in red: <span class="realspoiler">Imoen is your sister!</span>.
          <br><br>
            General suggestions
            <div class="divimp">
            Recruit Stivan (and the rest of your party) as soon as you're able to go to the
            Bridge District, enter all areas, do all quests, and let Stivan get hurt every now and then, and
            don't go to Spellhold too early or too late. You might miss some banters if you don't follow these instructions. 

            <br>In particular, the banters with Cernd require you to recruit him, complete Trademeet and Cernd's personal quest
            (<span class="midspoiler">Cernd's son</span>) before going to Spellhold.
            </div>
            <p><br>Conflicts</p>
            <div class="divimp">
            Stivan will never irremediably lock you out of an NPC or a quest path. He will irremediably leave the party if:
            <ul>
            <li>If the party reputation reaches 1 (same as all Neutral NPCs).</li>
            <li>If he is denied vengeance: <span class="midspoiler">Anomen must fail his test.</span>
            </li>
            <li>If you take too long in completing his first quest: <span class="midspoiler">you have eight days to
            give the urn to Lawrence</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            All other crisis points are solvable through dialogue and/or questing.
            </div>
            
            <p><br>Reaction to NPCs</p>
            <div class="divimp">
            At an high level, Stivan likes nobles, girls and anything exotic, while hating Nature, people with
            an Heroic Good attitude, and all sorts of flying things.
            <ul>
            <li>Aerie: He spends his time insulting her because she used to fly.
            <span class="midspoiler">She will eventually leave over his abuse; this starts the "Stivan and the
            Slavers" quest, after which she will rejoin the party.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
            Anomen: All they do is hurl insults (and threats) at each other... at least until Anomen's personal quest.
            <span class="midspoiler">If Anomen kills Saerk they will become close friends; otherwise, Stivan leaves
            permanently the party.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
            Cernd: He will try to make Stivan stop hating seagulls, and Stivan will react angrily to Cernd's lectures.
            <span class="realspoiler">Cernd *will* succeed at the very end of Shadows of Amn, making Stivan realize that
            he was completely in the wrong. Stivan will become Chaotic Good and adopt a new outlook on life, even adopting
            a <a href="portraits/nix_scars/tb%23sti2l.bmp">pet seagull</a>.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
            Edwin: they will spend their time mocking each other.
            </li>
            <li>
            Haer Dalis: Haer Dalis is only too happy to entartain Stivan's curiosity about the Planes.
            <span class="midspoiler">If only he didn't choose 'seagull' as a bird name for Stivan everything would be perfect.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
            Imoen: Trying to impress Imoen, he challenges her to a thieving duel and then offers to train each other.
            <span class="midspoiler">Imoen gets a +1 thac0 and damage out the deal, while Stivan gets one casting of Invisibility per day.</span> 
            </li>
            <li>
            Jaheira: being a druid, she objects to Stivan's campaign against seagulls. They still get along pretty fine
            when they aren't discussing flying creatures.
            </li>
            <li>
            Jan: Jan finds in Stivan a <s>eager</s> <s>willing</s> listener for his many stories.
            </li>
            <li>
            Keldorn: They exchange few words, even less of them pleasant.
            </li>
            <li>
            Korgan: Stivan is alternatively amused and scared by Korgan's extremely violent attitude.
            </li>
            <li>
            Mazzy: They don't like each other, but he still stands up for another Halfling when faced with the Big People.
            </li>
            <li>
            Minsc: Stivan doesn't like Minsc, but Minsc doesn't understand why.
            </li>
            <li>
            Nalia: He spends his time kissing the ground she walks on.
            </li>
            <li>
            Valygar: Stivan likes nobility and hates nature. Valygar's values are <i>a tad</i> different.
            </li>
            <li>
            Viconia: Viconia will outdo herself in mocking Stivan for his Garrick-like attempts at conversation.
            </li>
            <li>
            Yoshimo: Yoshimo is all too glad to have somebody
            interested in hearing of his exploits. <span class="realspoiler">After the death of Yoshimo, Stivan will
            eventually get to use his friend's personal blade.</span>

			<br>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using WinRAR. If properly extracted, you should have a stivan folder, and Setup-stivan.exe in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-stivan.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
			<br>
			<br>Please re-run Setup-stivan.exe in your BG2 folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

			<i>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. Please note that this mod is incompatible with Mod Organizer. </i> Stivan the Hunter is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder. If properly extracted, you should have a stivan folder, Setup-stivans, and Setup-stivan.command in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-stivan.command and follow the instructions on screen.

		<p>
		Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from
		<a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least)
		the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G.
		/usr/bin).
		<br>Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory,
	run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.
		<br><span class='small'>
		You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it
		once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered,
	so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either
		if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file
		name.
		<br>If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe
		bet.
		</span>
		<br>After that, run 'weinstall stivan' from your BG2
		installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.

				<h4>
					Compatibility notes
				</h4>
				<p>
				This mod uses the most up-to-date coding standards, to ensure compatibility with any other reasonably well
        coded mod.
        <br>These things require mention (in order from most severe to least):
        <div class="divimp"><ul>
        <li>Throne of Bhaal is an hard requirement (the mod won't install without it).</li>
        <li>The BG2 Fixpack is a soft requirement (the mod is only tested with the 
        Fixpack installed, but I will reactively provide support for non-Fixpacked games).</li>
        <li>Keeping Yoshimo: <span class="bigspoiler">Stivan considered Yoshimo as one of his best friends, and 
        Yoshimo's death plays a part in future banters.</span> As such, Keeping Yoshimo is conceptually incompatible
        with Stivan the Hunter.</li>
        <li>Ruad: if you upgrade Yoshimo's blade using Ruad, then Stivan won't be able to
        <span class="bigspoiler">use it or upgrade it.</span></li>
        <li>Edwin Romance: Edwin Romance should be installed BEFORE Stivan (doing so would make a single interjection
        funnier).</li>
        <li>Stivan will comment on the events of these mods, independently of install order:
          <ul>
          <li>Unfinished Business.</li>
          <li>Ding0's Quest Pack.</li>
          <li>Edwin Romance.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stivan is integrated in Crossmod. As of this writing, this adds:
          <ul>
          <li>4 interjections with Unfinished Business.</li>
          <li>Stivan will take Anomen's place during the events of Square Mod.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stivan is integrated in Level1NPC, allowing you to alter his class, stats, or initial skill spread.</li>
        </ul></div>
